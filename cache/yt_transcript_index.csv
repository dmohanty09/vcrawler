-223jAcyIBk,163.84,"of moon knight did you catch like there"
-223jAcyIBk,165.519,"was he walked under the light and the"
-223jAcyIBk,166.959,"the crescent moon like that's oh that's"
-223jAcyIBk,168.879,"my that's one of my favorite ones from"
-223jAcyIBk,170.0,"any trailer this this uh this is is it"
-223jAcyIBk,172.239,"too early to say that this might turn"
-223jAcyIBk,175.36,"into my favorite one of the marvel"
-223jAcyIBk,178.159,"that's not just me like talking hype"
-223jAcyIBk,181.2,"that is that is like oh my god that is"
-223jAcyIBk,183.36,"exactly my kind of show right there i"
-223jAcyIBk,185.68,"think that's the best trailer the"
-223jAcyIBk,186.64,"darkness the supernatural elements the"
-223jAcyIBk,188.8,"variety of performance by oscar isaac"
-223jAcyIBk,190.879,"because yeah this confirms that he is"
-223jAcyIBk,192.319,"going to be we were like speculating"
-223jAcyIBk,193.519,"before the trailer started of will they"
-223jAcyIBk,195.36,"get like different actors for some of"
-223jAcyIBk,196.72,"the personalities which one seems to be"
-223jAcyIBk,198.159,"the dominant personality though in this"
-223jAcyIBk,199.76,"trailer there seems to be one stephen"
-223jAcyIBk,201.28,"scene dominant"
-223jAcyIBk,202.64,"but i think that's a mislead because"
-223jAcyIBk,203.92,"mark is in the comic book is the"
-223jAcyIBk,205.36,"dominant one mercenary that gets taken"
-223jAcyIBk,207.12,"out by bushmaster yes and i assume"
-223jAcyIBk,209.44,"that's a mislead on purpose because it's"
-223jAcyIBk,210.959,"not a known character so maybe steven is"
-223jAcyIBk,212.799,"who we identify with in the first"
-223jAcyIBk,214.08,"episode yeah and therefore you think"
-223jAcyIBk,215.84,"he's this more posh well-to-do guy and"
-223jAcyIBk,218.0,"then maybe the second episode they"
-223jAcyIBk,219.12,"introduced the cabbie and we've got a"
-223jAcyIBk,220.72,"character you're like wait why is he now"
-223jAcyIBk,222.08,"this guy and like we slowly find mark"
-223jAcyIBk,224.0,"maybe like uncover his true self yeah"
-223jAcyIBk,226.48,"what i'm loving about it is like how"
-223jAcyIBk,228.0,"psychological it is like it's gonna deal"
-223jAcyIBk,230.319,"with the fact of how this kind of plays"
-223jAcyIBk,231.84,"on uh disassociative identity disorder"
-223jAcyIBk,234.319,"and the way how they visually represent"
-223jAcyIBk,236.319,"that through like the cracks and the"
-223jAcyIBk,237.76,"mirrors and the different"
-223jAcyIBk,239.36,"presences and the hallways and stuff"
-223jAcyIBk,240.879,"like that was so cool to behold and"
-223jAcyIBk,243.36,"oscar i think the cadence like that the"
-223jAcyIBk,245.92,"flavor of the edit which i hope the show"
-223jAcyIBk,247.519,"follows with man john what was your"
-223jAcyIBk,249.12,"favorite part about it oh man just the"
-223jAcyIBk,251.04,"the whole vibe and atmosphere really i"
-223jAcyIBk,252.879,"mean i like that this movie this trailer"
-223jAcyIBk,254.799,"played more like a movie trailer than a"
-223jAcyIBk,256.959,"tv show trailer and you know it is a six"
-223jAcyIBk,259.68,"episode contained series with the option"
-223jAcyIBk,261.919,"of going beyond that and i think that"
-223jAcyIBk,263.44,"this is the perfect way to just hook"
-223jAcyIBk,264.96,"everybody for yeah the kind of ride"
-223jAcyIBk,267.04,"we're into it looks like the kind of"
-223jAcyIBk,268.16,"thing that's going to be very fraught"
-223jAcyIBk,270.0,"and very paranoid and i love anything"
-223jAcyIBk,272.32,"that has that quality where you know"
-223jAcyIBk,274.0,"you've got flashes and echoes and what's"
-223jAcyIBk,276.32,"real which reflection is actually mine"
-223jAcyIBk,278.88,"you know ethan hawk looks"
-223jAcyIBk,281.04,"sinister as you know i wonder if he's"
-223jAcyIBk,282.479,"conscious"
-223jAcyIBk,284.24,"himself no no like like a i i said"
-223jAcyIBk,286.32,"country but someone working directly for"
-223jAcyIBk,287.84,"him like the voice of country like he's"
-223jAcyIBk,289.199,"okay"
-223jAcyIBk,290.0,"i don't think he's the actual god but"
-223jAcyIBk,292.16,"explain that a little bit for them so"
-223jAcyIBk,293.44,"basically mark spector is killed in an"
-223jAcyIBk,295.84,"incident as a mercenary xcia and he is"
-223jAcyIBk,299.12,"dragged into an egyptian temple where he"
-223jAcyIBk,301.759,"isn't actually alive or dead he's"
-223jAcyIBk,304.24,"basically revived in what he thinks is"
-223jAcyIBk,307.039,"serving the god of konchu he is the"
-223jAcyIBk,308.639,"moon's knight which is the egyptian god"
-223jAcyIBk,310.32,"of the night and basically the powers he"
-223jAcyIBk,312.32,"has yeah"
-223jAcyIBk,313.759,"and that's the difference between him in"
-223jAcyIBk,314.639,"batman so like batman is striking fear"
-223jAcyIBk,317.36,"because he wants to avenge his parents"
-223jAcyIBk,319.28,"he's in love with the concept of"
-223jAcyIBk,321.12,"vengeance so it's not about a specific"
-223jAcyIBk,322.8,"vengeance it's vengeance incarnate which"
-223jAcyIBk,324.4,"is what makes this character so"
-223jAcyIBk,325.36,"interesting he wears white as a threat"
-223jAcyIBk,327.68,"he wants you to see him he believes in"
-223jAcyIBk,329.12,"hurting those that deserve it and it's"
-223jAcyIBk,330.96,"unilateral it's anyone that deserves it"
-223jAcyIBk,332.56,"so he's striking fear for this god and"
-223jAcyIBk,335.759,"he doesn't really have a power set like"
-223jAcyIBk,338.08,"in some continuities as the moon wanes"
-223jAcyIBk,340.24,"some of his powers increase like if"
-223jAcyIBk,341.759,"there are some moon thailands i don't"
-223jAcyIBk,342.72,"know if they're going to do that but"
-223jAcyIBk,343.759,"konshu himself is a voice that speaks to"
-223jAcyIBk,345.919,"him and there's some continuities where"
-223jAcyIBk,347.52,"the voices in his head are catalyzed by"
-223jAcyIBk,349.84,"khanshu there's also some where konju"
-223jAcyIBk,351.68,"saw him as a young child wait until he"
-223jAcyIBk,353.36,"was old enough and then made him his"
-223jAcyIBk,354.96,"mercenary like it was all faded i don't"
-223jAcyIBk,356.72,"know which ones are gonna know i'm"
-223jAcyIBk,357.84,"assuming they'll do the one where it's"
-223jAcyIBk,359.36,"later in life he gets activated that"
-223jAcyIBk,361.28,"causes the voices to materialize there's"
-223jAcyIBk,363.68,"two main voices and then there's two"
-223jAcyIBk,365.759,"supporting voices um there's the inner"
-223jAcyIBk,367.84,"child and the uh mr knight which i think"
-223jAcyIBk,370.8,"will come in later and then there's jake"
-223jAcyIBk,373.039,"as well as stephen and i think we're"
-223jAcyIBk,374.72,"gonna get those very early on like i"
-223jAcyIBk,376.24,"said i think mark will be uh developed"
-223jAcyIBk,378.639,"the main"
-223jAcyIBk,379.6,"human self will come i don't know if"
-223jAcyIBk,381.039,"anything that made sense i think"
-223jAcyIBk,383.52,"i know i i know the anxiety of like"
-223jAcyIBk,385.68,"because i'm very interested as i was"
-223jAcyIBk,387.68,"catching we've done more than wikipedia"
-223jAcyIBk,389.28,"like i was catching on to let's catch up"
-223jAcyIBk,391.28,"where you're saying you said conscious"
-223jAcyIBk,392.16,"i'm like okay there might be some people"
-223jAcyIBk,393.12,"who don't know what's going on they're"
-223jAcyIBk,393.919,"like we got all this egyptian imagery in"
-223jAcyIBk,395.36,"here it looks like like the trailer"
-223jAcyIBk,397.039,"might have you believing that he gets it"
-223jAcyIBk,398.479,"like at the museum artifact spot but you"
-223jAcyIBk,400.319,"see i think you see a pyramid at one"
-223jAcyIBk,401.6,"point it was kind of moving by fast so i"
-223jAcyIBk,403.28,"imagine that his personality was"
-223jAcyIBk,404.96,"eventually at one point in egypt and"
-223jAcyIBk,406.8,"then he's probably just going to like"
-223jAcyIBk,408.319,"here are some authentic artifacts at"
-223jAcyIBk,410.16,"this museum that are being called to me"
-223jAcyIBk,411.84,"in some ways right like some people when"
-223jAcyIBk,413.759,"the teaser trailer came out what do you"
-223jAcyIBk,414.96,"think some people were saying that looks"
-223jAcyIBk,416.0,"like a werewolf some people were saying"
-223jAcyIBk,417.039,"looks like anubis i mean they've said"
-223jAcyIBk,418.8,"that egyptology is going to be a big"
-223jAcyIBk,420.96,"part of the show and so in that breath i"
-223jAcyIBk,423.759,"would imagine maybe something like that"
-223jAcyIBk,425.199,"but moon knight's origin also ties in"
-223jAcyIBk,426.96,"with the werewolf by night which i would"
-223jAcyIBk,428.96,"just be so excited to see them breach"
-223jAcyIBk,431.759,"further into especially because this is"
-223jAcyIBk,433.36,"also being billed as a scarier more"
-223jAcyIBk,435.44,"horror-centric series so i mean for for"
-223jAcyIBk,438.4,"my geeky heart i would be thrilled by"
-223jAcyIBk,440.319,"that although something a little more"
-223jAcyIBk,441.84,"egyptian would fit as well you know what"
-223jAcyIBk,444.72,"i really thought with ethan hawk it's"
-223jAcyIBk,446.72,"not exactly the same thing there were"
-223jAcyIBk,448.72,"vibes about parts of this trailer that"
-223jAcyIBk,450.8,"were making me reminisce on the first"
-223jAcyIBk,453.199,"blade movie"
-223jAcyIBk,454.56,"and steven dorff's like the the"
-223jAcyIBk,456.319,"villainous president that he had there"
-223jAcyIBk,457.759,"there was parts about ethan hawk that i"
-223jAcyIBk,459.36,"was thinking of i say that complimentary"
-223jAcyIBk,461.36,"wise his blade that is like i actually i"
-223jAcyIBk,463.68,"love that first movie started marvel and"
-223jAcyIBk,465.36,"then you know we were thinking about the"
-223jAcyIBk,466.72,"future of like a darker avengers set"
-223jAcyIBk,468.96,"like the midnight suns and having blade"
-223jAcyIBk,471.44,"possibly come into the mix here and"
-223jAcyIBk,474.0,"maybe blade might cap like he had a"
-223jAcyIBk,476.4,"voiceover cameo in eternals post credit"
-223jAcyIBk,478.72,"scene spoilers by the way sorry i don't"
-223jAcyIBk,480.56,"give a heads up but yeah yeah that came"
-223jAcyIBk,482.479,"in here and i was like it would make"
-223jAcyIBk,483.52,"more sense for even blaze to appear here"
-223jAcyIBk,485.599,"if they're like teasing his appearances"
-223jAcyIBk,487.44,"as guest starring how neat would that be"
-223jAcyIBk,489.36,"in the revived term i could totally see"
-223jAcyIBk,491.039,"blade guest starring in this show and"
-223jAcyIBk,492.56,"spoilers for no way home daredevil also"
-223jAcyIBk,494.8,"allows this could set the precedent for"
-223jAcyIBk,496.56,"a dark show to allow daredevil to be as"
-223jAcyIBk,498.24,"dark since it is canon to the netflix"
-223jAcyIBk,499.759,"show which is much darker than the mcu"
-223jAcyIBk,502.0,"this would allow that universe to exist"
-223jAcyIBk,503.84,"alongside the mcu you can do a marvelous"
-223jAcyIBk,505.68,"you can do something with daredevil like"
-223jAcyIBk,506.96,"that more ultra violence that's one of"
-223jAcyIBk,508.72,"the things i was really gravitated"
-223jAcyIBk,509.84,"towards about this trailer was when"
-223jAcyIBk,510.879,"you're hearing moon knight when you're"
-223jAcyIBk,511.84,"learning about him you're like wow this"
-223jAcyIBk,513.279,"sounds like this would have to be a"
-223jAcyIBk,514.479,"really dark almost like closer to the"
-223jAcyIBk,516.959,"netflix shows than any of the other"
-223jAcyIBk,518.399,"disney plush shows that we've gone in so"
-223jAcyIBk,519.919,"far other than some you know certain"
-223jAcyIBk,521.44,"shots that look really pop in the colors"
-223jAcyIBk,522.959,"in that mcu fashion for the most part"
-223jAcyIBk,524.959,"the tone the mood the atmosphere of it i"
-223jAcyIBk,527.839,"want to get a better sense of the"
-223jAcyIBk,528.72,"atmosphere honestly because i'm like we"
-223jAcyIBk,530.56,"got like that cool music that i thought"
-223jAcyIBk,532.48,"complemented the trailer well but i do"
-223jAcyIBk,534.16,"want to get a better sense of like what"
-223jAcyIBk,535.44,"will some of these scenes feel like and"
-223jAcyIBk,537.519,"so far i'm loving it can i say like the"
-223jAcyIBk,539.2,"directing in this uh two of my buddies i"
-223jAcyIBk,541.04,"love these guys to death justin and"
-223jAcyIBk,542.24,"aaron are are two of the best directors"
-223jAcyIBk,544.16,"working and i'm honored to call them"
-223jAcyIBk,545.36,"friends they make that's the only reason"
-223jAcyIBk,547.12,"you're recommending this i'm yes i'm"
-223jAcyIBk,548.959,"only here for them so uh if you haven't"
-223jAcyIBk,550.72,"seen spring if you haven't seen"
-223jAcyIBk,551.839,"synchronics if you haven't seen the"
-223jAcyIBk,552.959,"endless check out their work the reason"
-223jAcyIBk,554.72,"i think they suit this so well is they"
-223jAcyIBk,556.399,"do this insane existential pondering"
-223jAcyIBk,559.04,"this otherworldly this this atmospheric"
-223jAcyIBk,561.68,"tone that's going to suit this so well"
-223jAcyIBk,563.36,"they're like hp lovecraft vibes that i"
-223jAcyIBk,565.68,"think are going to really tie into how"
-223jAcyIBk,566.959,"this mythology looks visually yeah and"
-223jAcyIBk,569.12,"both of these guys are they've done"
-223jAcyIBk,571.279,"everything on a set they've done every"
-223jAcyIBk,572.959,"single job on the set and now they're"
-223jAcyIBk,574.24,"directing one of the coolest most hard"
-223jAcyIBk,576.16,"to discern characters so these guys are"
-223jAcyIBk,578.0,"going to be so hands on they're going to"
-223jAcyIBk,579.36,"make this their own and that's why i"
-223jAcyIBk,580.64,"think this looks so unique is justin and"
-223jAcyIBk,582.24,"aaron are geniuses and this is going to"
-223jAcyIBk,583.6,"show for it so uh can we have them on"
-223jAcyIBk,585.92,"the channel for an interview i mean"

-ai2cSwSOnQ,132.95,"choke the person to arm lock the person"
-ai2cSwSOnQ,134.84,"great now in a situation in a self"

-ai2cSwSOnQ,142.73,"lock okay so one Jennifer feels the arms"
-ai2cSwSOnQ,145.04,"exposed she's gonna angle her body she's"
-ai2cSwSOnQ,148.19,"gonna trap the arm angles her body so"

-ai2cSwSOnQ,179.42,"your arm okay it's a very good technique"

-ai2cSwSOnQ,183.68,"here that's ideal that's more for the"
-ai2cSwSOnQ,185.989,"worst case she's on her back right"
-ai2cSwSOnQ,187.19,"you're in between the legs now she's"
-ai2cSwSOnQ,189.62,"gonna go but what an attempt to lure the"

-e9ftOgjOgI,8.58,"escapes specifically how do you do mount"
-e9ftOgjOgI,11.19,"escapes what do you do if somebody's on"
-e9ftOgjOgI,12.66,"top either punching you in the face"
-e9ftOgjOgI,14.549,"dropping elbows on yet how do you get"
-e9ftOgjOgI,16.23,"out first thing you should realize is"
-e9ftOgjOgI,18.81,"full mouth is actually not just one"
-e9ftOgjOgI,20.64,"position there are several different"
-e9ftOgjOgI,21.9,"positions right now Jess is sitting on"
-e9ftOgjOgI,24.119,"the hips in a low mount position this is"
-e9ftOgjOgI,26.34,"ideal for escape because she's sitting"
-e9ftOgjOgI,29.279,"on my hips know when I elevate the hips"
-e9ftOgjOgI,31.08,"just moves too so if I do something like"
-e9ftOgjOgI,34.29,"trap this arm with my head out of the"
-e9ftOgjOgI,37.14,"way and the bridge in this direction"
-e9ftOgjOgI,41.69,"this is gonna fall into that empty space"
-e9ftOgjOgI,45.629,"the laminate my head is probably the"
-e9ftOgjOgI,47.67,"most important part of that she's"
-e9ftOgjOgI,52.14,"sitting on the hips right here I trap it"
-e9ftOgjOgI,55.5,"arm bonus points again get this leg"
-e9ftOgjOgI,58.5,"right here that's not the most important"
-e9ftOgjOgI,60.329,"thing this is move that head out of the"
-e9ftOgjOgI,62.94,"way I've got an empty space right here"
-e9ftOgjOgI,64.86,"I'm just trying to stop that boy you"
-e9ftOgjOgI,66.45,"have a free arm so if I start ruling"
-e9ftOgjOgI,69.72,"over she puts that on them because"
-e9ftOgjOgI,72.03,"there's no exposure if I keep going the"
-e9ftOgjOgI,75.9,"wall but if I keep my head in the center"
-e9ftOgjOgI,79.049,"and I do all of the other body mechanics"
-e9ftOgjOgI,81.81,"the same way now stop that fall notice"
-e9ftOgjOgI,89.31,"just is able to stay on top right it's"
-e9ftOgjOgI,94.009,"super important to create negative space"
-e9ftOgjOgI,96.479,"in the empty space right there like"
-e9ftOgjOgI,98.13,"moving my head sideways now thank you"
-e9ftOgjOgI,101.36,"so football it's not so easy and leveled"
-e9ftOgjOgI,104.99,"into a high mountain posture episode so"
-e9ftOgjOgI,108.17,"instead of sitting on me there's like"
-e9ftOgjOgI,109.76,"some space between the pelvis and the"
-e9ftOgjOgI,112.37,"chest and you can pitch the knees"
-e9ftOgjOgI,114.98,"together a little bit it was my own"
-e9ftOgjOgI,117.02,"start here this is a very different"
-e9ftOgjOgI,118.64,"position than where she was before now 9"
-e9ftOgjOgI,121.28,"o'clock then heal my hips she doesn't"
-e9ftOgjOgI,123.86,"move because she's not sitting on them"
-e9ftOgjOgI,125.33,"she's up here on the chest high so what"
-e9ftOgjOgI,127.67,"I need to do is move from this high"
-e9ftOgjOgI,129.56,"mount position back to a low mount"
-e9ftOgjOgI,131.15,"position so make a frame make a fist"
-e9ftOgjOgI,133.73,"put my hands my head right there on the"
-e9ftOgjOgI,136.58,"wrist and put this frame right here on"
-e9ftOgjOgI,139.43,"her hip or my legs you've heard of"
-e9ftOgjOgI,142.01,"stripping escaping no that's not gonna"
-e9ftOgjOgI,144.68,"get you out of mount but it'll put you"
-e9ftOgjOgI,147.14,"into Lamont it's a transition from from"
-e9ftOgjOgI,150.38,"high mountain Lomond no notice were just"
-e9ftOgjOgI,152.84,"says now she's sitting on my hips again"
-e9ftOgjOgI,154.55,"and her hands are closer to the floor"
-e9ftOgjOgI,156.89,"where I can grab one arm up here in a"
-e9ftOgjOgI,168.38,"very vulnerable position they can land"
-e9ftOgjOgI,170.0,"strikes it's imperative she changes"
-e9ftOgjOgI,172.61,"position it moves up into a low mount"
-e9ftOgjOgI,174.86,"position she makes not trying to push"
-e9ftOgjOgI,176.36,"this with your legs and even if she"
-e9ftOgjOgI,178.34,"can't scrub out that was now I'm sitting"
-e9ftOgjOgI,180.89,"here so she contracted or now"
-e9ftOgjOgI,186.64,"on top that's generally the first thing"
-e9ftOgjOgI,191.75,"I'll try to escape Mount wait there's"
-e9ftOgjOgI,195.56,"more"
-e9ftOgjOgI,196.159,"sometimes we'll try to make this happen"
-e9ftOgjOgI,200.18,"and they're gonna move this leg out"
-e9ftOgjOgI,202.97,"oh no I can't roll her over that leg is"
-e9ftOgjOgI,207.859,"in the way"
-e9ftOgjOgI,208.459,"well if you remember shrimping in there"
-e9ftOgjOgI,211.549,"space for this leg to come out and to"
-e9ftOgjOgI,216.019,"come out that way so we're gonna bring a"
-e9ftOgjOgI,219.109,"big one you did serve something if you"
-e9ftOgjOgI,220.639,"don't know what that is I'll take a"
-e9ftOgjOgI,222.62,"little video of that I'm trying to"
-e9ftOgjOgI,224.98,"bridge so bring the leg up the bubbles"
-e9ftOgjOgI,228.68,"now there's a big space I can't push"
-e9ftOgjOgI,231.079,"there that way she's too stable switch"
-e9ftOgjOgI,233.209,"directions"
-e9ftOgjOgI,233.9,"well you're bowing out on this side and"

-e9ftOgjOgI,281.0,"she's up in the high mountain again I"
-e9ftOgjOgI,282.56,"needed to frame on the hip and pushing"

-e9ftOgjOgI,299.84,"inform out"
-e9ftOgjOgI,302.35,"that it becomes a question of how did"
-e9ftOgjOgI,304.75,"you just have fun yeah we make the frame"
-e9ftOgjOgI,308.13,"run to the side scoop under this leg and"
-e9ftOgjOgI,312.16,"once I'm pushing with my elbow lifted"

-V4vEyhWDZ0,107.1,"doesn't have the desired effect in terms"

-V4vEyhWDZ0,113.34,"they don't feel pain like other people"

-V4vEyhWDZ0,118.68,"outcome you're still getting chosen now"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,119.909,"you have one second laughs and you pass"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,121.38,"right hold my neck tightly instead of"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,123.509,"hitting tied up tight come on Asia I use"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,126.75,"my entire body to target her two thumbs"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,129.479,"so again as you ball instead of trying"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,131.67,"to fight on forearm you're strong - look"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,133.59,"I bet I step back on my strong side and"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,135.959,"I bow down your does cannot stop a whole"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,139.65,"body from going and this is targeting"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,141.45,"your strength against their weakest"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,142.59,"point of their grip so first thing"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,144.39,"tighten up your neck strong neck yes and"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,146.16,"now you're gonna step back as you do"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,147.569,"your step you're gonna duck under make"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,149.19,"sure your head doesn't touch my wrist go"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,150.33,"straight through and she's out nice so"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,152.79,"the key on the tight neck is that I"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,153.93,"can't get in and penetrate in the"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,155.31,"arteries there there you go so once you"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,158.519,"want that triple chin you guys we call"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,160.47,"it alligator neck when we teach the"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,161.73,"children tighten it up you guys always"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,163.53,"tighten that bow straight forward go"

-V4vEyhWDZ0,169.14,"straight down one of the most common"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,170.73,"mistakes on this one hold my neck"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,171.78,"squeeze is you bow on your head hits the"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,173.58,"wrist yeah you don't want your head to"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,175.47,"hit the wrist straight down and back up"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,177.75,"so go underneath the wrist so that all"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,179.19,"your energy is targeting those two"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,180.36,"thumbs not their arm or their wrist"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,182.519,"right yeah next time for you the person"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,184.799,"sneaks up you can't set a boundary if"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,186.78,"you can't see the person so they sneak"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,188.67,"up and they wrap you around the neck and"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,190.65,"now they're trying to drag you into"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,191.79,"isolation the question is what would we"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,194.01,"naturally do to get those hands pull it"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,195.42,"up pull it up we're going we're going by"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,197.19,"everybody everybody we're gonna do a"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,202.32,"forward step with this foot step forward"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,203.85,"and then this foot is gonna step between"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,205.739,"our bodies and you're gonna dip that"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,207.39,"shoulder until you end on this side of"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,208.65,"my body correct it's called the shoulder"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,210.329,"slip so I'm gonna dragging you here you"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,212.28,"can even use your hands to protect your"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,213.45,"neck initially but take one step forward"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,214.92,"slip through it now hug my body from"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,216.239,"here push away and push off yes"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,217.65,"so initially once you turn you may still"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,219.66,"be holding on to your neck so do it"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,221.28,"again slope step forward step through"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,223.14,"slow well now come here at this point"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,225.329,"he's gonna try to strike her then you"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,226.41,"push off both hands and you get away"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,227.43,"beautiful if she does the exact same"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,229.14,"thing the opposite way do it very slowly"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,230.94,"Asia slow step forward correct slow step"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,233.1,"through freeze it just got tighter"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,235.459,"there's an opening over here this is"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,238.079,"close so if you're gonna back out look"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,241.019,"she's gonna back out towards the opening"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,242.64,"step forward step five she looks"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,244.08,"unraveling the chill obviously a little"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,245.88,"bit tighter it's harder to do but with"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,247.77,"practice you really learn that once you"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,249.18,"slip your shoulder out you're choking"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,250.98,"the choke is gone so if they're"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,252.93,"left-handed yes you got it looks good"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,255.24,"luck on this one good luck good luck"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,256.92,"nice so they slip and then you're out"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,258.84,"beautiful so next one let's go to the"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,262.89,"wall over here okay grab my throw here"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,266.28,"and just keep your face away I want to"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,267.99,"actually double yeah so check it out I'm"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,271.68,"gonna turn all in one palm strike foot"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,275.37,"pivot look at the foot boom"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,277.08,"most common mistake they hit the other"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,278.73,"way when you hit this way you're"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,280.08,"fighting four fingers when you hit this"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,281.49,"way you're fighting just about just like"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,283.35,"the first yes where is the weakness and"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,285.96,"the weakest is right there here's what's"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,287.22,"interesting if you push this move is so"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,289.32,"good that just like hitting but hand"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,292.14,"falls off the neck so my pivot isn't as"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,293.91,"important if not more important than hit"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,295.53,"so really think of that foot look at the"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,297.27,"foot rotating on the ground as my"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,299.4,"shoulder pivots through and everything"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,301.65,"and then your hands gonna slide right at"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,303.0,"the same time I'm gonna palm strike"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,304.71,"mainly because as I do I want you to"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,307.11,"fall in right here would set me up with"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,308.61,"this rat boom so right here try that"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,310.169,"pivot go yes that rep connect tight"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,312.66,"tight tight tight now left they have"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,314.01,"squeeze squeeze"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,314.94,"ah here we go big turn yes any come"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,317.88,"around man her guillotines are tied to"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,322.11,"touch me that nice it's called the mount"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,325.95,"okay a very common fighting position or"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,328.05,"you want to be as them as the top person"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,330.12,"and if you're on the bottom you never"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,331.47,"want to be here but from of self-defense"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,332.82,"perspective the reason why it's so"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,334.38,"problematic is this make a fist and even"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,341.97,"if she could reach me she wouldn't have"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,343.71,"the power but I have to make a fist even"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,345.419,"if you hit me I'm gonna ride with it"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,346.58,"what if I hit you your face bounces off"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,349.44,"the pavement yeah so you have very"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,351.33,"limited power and very limited options"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,353.22,"from here in terms of striking now I"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,354.87,"already know some of our viewers at home"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,356.1,"are thinking hit him in the where it"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,357.63,"counts boom same thing if you knock them"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,359.94,"out great yeah but if you don't guess"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,362.43,"what we have now"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,363.849,"firepower that is to your disadvantage"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,365.259,"this is actually really scary even"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,367.899,"though I know you're not gonna hurt me"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,369.429,"just you being on top of me is very"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,371.169,"scary how would someone how would you"
-V4vEyhWDZ0,373.36,"and probably similar to our friends at"

0A2dUl_2Fao,177.659,"is smother to hold down if she feels"
0A2dUl_2Fao,179.579,"like she can just throw a front kick"
0A2dUl_2Fao,180.719,"from an oral fighting stance that's what"

0sZ7Y16iWWY,55.41,"favorite ways of separating these elbows"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,57.21,"I take my hand and I'm gonna post it on"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,60.239,"the Inc in Turkish of the neck right"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,62.219,"from that of the neck meets the shoulder"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,64.46,"hands out of the trunk drive as much"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,66.6,"surface area as I can so my fingers are"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,68.58,"splayed out right and I'm going to my"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,72.15,"other hand come far and I'm gonna drive"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,73.83,"my hips up starting with the opposite"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,76.35,"knee of the hands in the neck right so"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,78.09,"here"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,79.17,"my leg up my foot then bites it on the"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,81.659,"hip so that I don't lose any any"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,83.85,"placement and then I brew my other leg"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,86.13,"up both of my feet again tucked in on"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,87.93,"the hips here like a ladder so that when"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,89.939,"I gain that position I don't go"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,91.649,"backwards right there elbows this will"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,94.5,"have the good effect of scraping"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,96.03,"underneath those elbows as you see"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,97.92,"they'll be trying to fight these elbows"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,100.259,"back down most of the time I'm gonna"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,102.299,"allow one of these elbows to come back"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,104.399,"down but I'm going to keep the other one"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,105.78,"up here with me so what I like to do is"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,108.149,"I like to help push this one down as I"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,110.58,"raised this knee up I push this down"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,113.34,"then immediately collapse my knee on it"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,115.74,"again so I lift this up push claps down"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,118.89,"over around the wrist area is going by"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,121.289,"it now here a lot of times my opponent"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,125.13,"will bring this elbow to the ground and"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,126.78,"slide out the back door like so what I"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,130.83,"do to prevent that is I collect the head"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,133.65,"so immediately after pushing this down"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,135.12,"and biting I swim this under and lift"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,137.34,"the head into the air this prevents my"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,139.41,"opponent from getting the angle they"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,140.85,"need to escape so she tries right it's"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,144.12,"extraordinarily difficult from here I"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,146.88,"can bring up my other leg to start"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,148.709,"getting the angle I'm gonna kick this"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,150.72,"heel around and into my triangle"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,153.48,"position I can wrap my forearm under"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,156.299,"their head again pretty small headspace"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,158.34,"close I grab my other shin I lean"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,160.62,"forward bring my knee to the ground and"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,162.69,"instead of trying to get this foot"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,164.31,"behind this I'm just gonna lift this"
0sZ7Y16iWWY,165.66,"foot up into the air here and bring my"

1lRpavXGXsg,439.69,"injured I'm asked the question don't you"
1lRpavXGXsg,442.96,"run a risk that you're teaching women"
1lRpavXGXsg,444.159,"how to deal with an assailant but if"
1lRpavXGXsg,446.02,"they deal with a real rapist they might"
1lRpavXGXsg,447.49,"get hurt by fighting back and what do"
1lRpavXGXsg,449.8,"you think is going to happen a woman if"
1lRpavXGXsg,451.3,"she doesn't protect herself"
1lRpavXGXsg,452.53,"critics I'm fighting back commonly"
1lRpavXGXsg,454.69,"telemon don't fight or you're going to"
1lRpavXGXsg,456.669,"get hurt but what they don't tell you is"
1lRpavXGXsg,459.19,"is that you're going to get hurt in a"
1lRpavXGXsg,460.69,"much much deeper way and that's inside"
1lRpavXGXsg,463.09,"so you get hurt so you scrape your arm"
1lRpavXGXsg,465.88,"you sprained your ankle so what that's"
1lRpavXGXsg,469.0,"nothing if you don't have to carry"
1lRpavXGXsg,470.59,"around the emotional scars inside you"
1lRpavXGXsg,472.029,"for the rest of your life"
1lRpavXGXsg,473.229,"we don't tell women that they have to"
1lRpavXGXsg,475.12,"fight back we just give them a tool we"
1lRpavXGXsg,477.4,"give them a choice if they want to fight"
1lRpavXGXsg,479.62,"back"
1lRpavXGXsg,480.13,"great then they fight back but if they"
1lRpavXGXsg,482.08,"feel by fighting back that they're gonna"
1lRpavXGXsg,483.61,"get killed then by all means submit to"
1lRpavXGXsg,485.71,"the rape because the real point about"
1lRpavXGXsg,487.75,"all of this is that you come out of it a"
1lRpavXGXsg,489.699,"winner and if you're alive and you've"
1lRpavXGXsg,491.56,"been raped so what just as long as"
1lRpavXGXsg,493.479,"you're alive that makes you a winner few"
1lRpavXGXsg,495.729,"graduates are ever tested outside the"
1lRpavXGXsg,497.44,"classroom but that's the point if you"
1lRpavXGXsg,500.169,"don't act like a victim you may not"

2ktkiNV9i-s,8.3,"okay so our tip of the day today is if"
2ktkiNV9i-s,11.49,"somebody grabs you from behind and locks"
2ktkiNV9i-s,13.62,"your arms into position so you can't"
2ktkiNV9i-s,15.509,"fight back so for example your hands are"
2ktkiNV9i-s,17.85,"tight together and I can't fight or"
2ktkiNV9i-s,21.09,"can't move with my arms the more I"
2ktkiNV9i-s,23.34,"struggle the harder he's going to grab"
2ktkiNV9i-s,25.26,"me he's going to control my body a"
2ktkiNV9i-s,27.18,"little bit more see what I want to do I"
2ktkiNV9i-s,29.039,"don't want him to concentrate on this I"
2ktkiNV9i-s,30.84,"want to hit him at least once to get him"
2ktkiNV9i-s,34.2,"to think of pain so I go in step if you"
2ktkiNV9i-s,37.23,"have high heels it works beautiful you"
2ktkiNV9i-s,39.3,"can actually kick towards a shin you can"
2ktkiNV9i-s,41.82,"headbutt back anything that you can do"
2ktkiNV9i-s,44.34,"to get him to release a little bit of"
2ktkiNV9i-s,46.559,"the hold then what you want to do is"
2ktkiNV9i-s,48.51,"drop your body weight straight down see"
2ktkiNV9i-s,50.52,"what happens he comes down with me"
2ktkiNV9i-s,52.68,"because he's grabbing me hard his body"
2ktkiNV9i-s,55.62,"weight falls forward with me so he then"
2ktkiNV9i-s,58.649,"both legs you reach back because his"
2ktkiNV9i-s,61.829,"body's already forward I'm an advantage"
2ktkiNV9i-s,64.799,"to use his body weight to help me and he"
2ktkiNV9i-s,69.24,"falls down then what you want to do you"
2ktkiNV9i-s,71.01,"don't want to cook you want to finish"
2ktkiNV9i-s,72.33,"him first go strike towards the groin"
2ktkiNV9i-s,74.939,"it's the best target you want to aim for"

2STkxS5tm1k,17.359,"bro are you here bro"
2STkxS5tm1k,21.199,"same story day"
2STkxS5tm1k,24.0,"whatever"
2STkxS5tm1k,25.199,"y'all go get coffee"
2STkxS5tm1k,27.43,"[Music]"
2STkxS5tm1k,32.719,"you"
2UxI7s1dQik,9.27,"so we're gonna do is we're gonna start"
2UxI7s1dQik,10.74,"from the mount position first and so"
2UxI7s1dQik,14.04,"happens a feather for a week seated up"
2UxI7s1dQik,16.34,"top of me this way now there's we're"
2UxI7s1dQik,19.38,"going to look at a couple of different"
2UxI7s1dQik,20.46,"situations here the first of all being"
2UxI7s1dQik,23.099,"in the MA position if she's in the"
2UxI7s1dQik,25.529,"upright when trying to hit me a slapping"
2UxI7s1dQik,27.75,"like this there's a couple of things"
2UxI7s1dQik,29.399,"that we could do one is this to put your"
2UxI7s1dQik,31.2,"hands up from this position note that my"
2UxI7s1dQik,33.239,"knees are up very high about down here"
2UxI7s1dQik,35.28,"but they're very high almost is in the"
2UxI7s1dQik,37.23,"back and you can drive these into each"
2UxI7s1dQik,39.0,"of the back to help too as well"
2UxI7s1dQik,40.71,"but the first thing we're going to do is"
2UxI7s1dQik,42.09,"we're going to break our movement up"
2UxI7s1dQik,43.559,"this way all right"
2UxI7s1dQik,45.719,"the idea is to get them to post their"
2UxI7s1dQik,48.0,"arms down okay so it's not a gentler"
2UxI7s1dQik,50.46,"you're not just lifting up your actually"
2UxI7s1dQik,52.469,"thrusting and very quickly have your"
2UxI7s1dQik,54.089,"hands here in bridge rigid but this way"
2UxI7s1dQik,56.579,"to get them up okay so let's try that"
2UxI7s1dQik,58.44,"much with our partners first right"
2UxI7s1dQik,60.239,"gentle show you and then we'll try that"
2UxI7s1dQik,61.559,"come on"
2UxI7s1dQik,62.489,"so again that's what we have that's on"
2UxI7s1dQik,66.0,"so you have somebody that's in the mount"
2UxI7s1dQik,67.23,"position that's looking is doing this"
2UxI7s1dQik,69.56,"and that's what you want them to do you"
2UxI7s1dQik,72.09,"want them"
2UxI7s1dQik,78.96,"and this technique is going to continue"
2UxI7s1dQik,81.28,"through we're going to do it different"
2UxI7s1dQik,83.56,"phases so against my bridge from here my"
2UxI7s1dQik,86.799,"I could use you to the left or right"
2UxI7s1dQik,88.659,"hand most of us are predominantly"
2UxI7s1dQik,90.369,"right-handed so we're just going to slip"
2UxI7s1dQik,92.32,"that hand around this way so it comes on"
2UxI7s1dQik,94.09,"the outside of the elbow notice that I"
2UxI7s1dQik,95.409,"did not sit back down they stayed in the"
2UxI7s1dQik,97.299,"British position but I just bring my"
2UxI7s1dQik,99.25,"hand around and then I'm gonna grab my"
2UxI7s1dQik,100.99,"whole arm this wedding now ideally what"
2UxI7s1dQik,103.99,"we would do is pull them to us but you"
2UxI7s1dQik,106.42,"know if the person weighs 200 pounds or"
2UxI7s1dQik,108.34,"so that might not be an easy thing to do"
2UxI7s1dQik,110.2,"so you can bring your hands at their"
2UxI7s1dQik,112.0,"head - that will work just as well okay"
2UxI7s1dQik,114.22,"so we'll go back to the starting"
2UxI7s1dQik,115.33,"position we're here cover your face"
2UxI7s1dQik,116.77,"because that may be what's going on"
2UxI7s1dQik,118.209,"Briggs remained in the bridge position"
2UxI7s1dQik,120.36,"take your right hand go right through"
2UxI7s1dQik,122.679,"the elbow so I went on the outside take"
2UxI7s1dQik,125.56,"my left hand and grab and and pull"
2UxI7s1dQik,127.119,"myself over pulling pulling that arm"
2UxI7s1dQik,129.22,"right up feel like it's a teddy bear and"
2UxI7s1dQik,130.63,"a hug didn't break just like that"
2UxI7s1dQik,132.31,"okay let's try that that's the next"
2UxI7s1dQik,134.29,"level"
2UxI7s1dQik,141.86,"in this position I have my knees back"
2UxI7s1dQik,143.96,"very high I put my rich she posts and I"
2UxI7s1dQik,148.07,"pull the arm over from here what I'm"
2UxI7s1dQik,151.04,"going to do this because I'm using my"
2UxI7s1dQik,152.27,"right arm I'm going to roll to my right"
2UxI7s1dQik,154.49,"side now to do that I'm going to push"
2UxI7s1dQik,156.8,"with my left foot and lift with my left"
2UxI7s1dQik,159.74,"side of my head this way so I'm going to"
2UxI7s1dQik,161.33,"roll to my right and at the same time"
2UxI7s1dQik,163.4,"I'm going to bring my left elbow over so"
2UxI7s1dQik,165.41,"think of yourself with scaring the cart"
2UxI7s1dQik,167.0,"to the right you're gonna make a right"
2UxI7s1dQik,168.35,"hand firm and he's going to roll the"
2UxI7s1dQik,170.24,"person over this way okay now from here"
2UxI7s1dQik,173.93,"we're gonna have a few options that you"
2UxI7s1dQik,175.49,"can work on there isn't if you're"
2UxI7s1dQik,177.17,"defending yourself so right here Ridge"
2UxI7s1dQik,179.42,"post grab you could take this elbow"
2UxI7s1dQik,182.15,"because now their face is close to you"
2UxI7s1dQik,184.19,"you can bring that elbow up at the"
2UxI7s1dQik,189.29,"throat and as you do that you roll them"
2UxI7s1dQik,191.99,"over by holding onto that arm when you"
2UxI7s1dQik,194.48,"now you're now in the top position and"
2UxI7s1dQik,196.94,"you take that belt forearm you just be"
2UxI7s1dQik,198.71,"placing into their throat this way okay"
2UxI7s1dQik,201.83,"then again we haven't done anything"
2UxI7s1dQik,203.33,"really"
2UxI7s1dQik,219.51,"comes across"
2UxI7s1dQik,230.51,"now there are some obvious other things"
2UxI7s1dQik,232.849,"that we are going to do at this point so"
2UxI7s1dQik,234.89,"over here in this position now from here"
2UxI7s1dQik,240.319,"if my opponent is in the upright"
2UxI7s1dQik,242.269,"position I clearly have an opportunity"
2UxI7s1dQik,244.489,"to punch to the lower torso or into the"
2UxI7s1dQik,247.129,"groin area"
2UxI7s1dQik,247.97,"doesn't matter if it's male or female"
2UxI7s1dQik,249.349,"that still hurts no matter who it is so"
2UxI7s1dQik,251.209,"you would punch punch bridge grab them"
2UxI7s1dQik,254.36,"bring them over same thing not from here"
2UxI7s1dQik,256.85,"you still have that opportunity pick"
2UxI7s1dQik,258.739,"it's a bottom little area for a brutal"
2UxI7s1dQik,260.69,"for all gender pump you can hit stand up"
2UxI7s1dQik,263.3,"hit again and leave and run away yeah so"
2UxI7s1dQik,267.71,"you got to stick around so again so"
2UxI7s1dQik,270.32,"we're here I'm here it's Jennifer"
2UxI7s1dQik,274.25,"slapping I strike the left grab roll"
2UxI7s1dQik,279.86,"over press punch left punch kick and go"
2UxI7s1dQik,285.289,"away okay so that gentle gently try that"

3dNZA5YivtA,380.4,"here watching them do nothing for the"
3dNZA5YivtA,382.16,"last hundred years not a lot has changed"
3dNZA5YivtA,384.8,"we have 95 beast which is a little bit"
3dNZA5YivtA,386.88,"up from what it was but honestly i don't"
3dNZA5YivtA,388.8,"think it's these guys and here's my"
3dNZA5YivtA,390.639,"evidence in our little blocky pixel"
3dNZA5YivtA,392.56,"world we can make out a couple of things"
3dNZA5YivtA,394.479,"like there's the volcano and those"
3dNZA5YivtA,396.4,"little pixels moving around are the"
3dNZA5YivtA,398.08,"rhinos and the buffalo which means what"
3dNZA5YivtA,400.24,"are these little white things moving"
3dNZA5YivtA,401.6,"around well let's find out oh crabs who"
3dNZA5YivtA,404.4,"knew they could survive a heat laser"
3dNZA5YivtA,406.08,"from space or that they could live to be"
3dNZA5YivtA,408.08,"87 years old but anyway these crabs"
3dNZA5YivtA,410.72,"would explain this discrepancy in the"
3dNZA5YivtA,412.319,"amount meaning that over here the"
3dNZA5YivtA,413.84,"population is staying exactly the same"
3dNZA5YivtA,416.08,"well that's not super exciting but you"
3dNZA5YivtA,417.84,"know what would be adding more stuff so"
3dNZA5YivtA,419.84,"let's re-add a bunch of nature we"
3dNZA5YivtA,421.52,"already have our rhinos and buffalo so"
3dNZA5YivtA,423.199,"we don't need to add that but for all"
3dNZA5YivtA,424.56,"these other things we're gonna add 50 of"
3dNZA5YivtA,426.319,"each and we're just gonna let them duke"
3dNZA5YivtA,427.919,"it out and figure it out on their own"
3dNZA5YivtA,429.44,"okay there we go a big disgusting"
3dNZA5YivtA,431.44,"overlapping pile of pixels oh yeah"
3dNZA5YivtA,433.759,"perfect harmony on nature just watching"
3dNZA5YivtA,436.639,"little pixel creatures fight other pixel"
3dNZA5YivtA,438.8,"creatures hey wait a minute who invited"
3dNZA5YivtA,440.72,"you i love watching this one monkey run"
3dNZA5YivtA,442.88,"from all these rhinos oh and just like"
3dNZA5YivtA,444.88,"that after a little bit of fighting"
3dNZA5YivtA,446.319,"looks like the dust settled and now"
3dNZA5YivtA,447.759,"there's all kinds of creatures on here"
3dNZA5YivtA,449.36,"can't really tell by taking a quick"
3dNZA5YivtA,450.88,"glance but i think all they did is kill"
3dNZA5YivtA,452.8,"the wolves and that might be it now that"
3dNZA5YivtA,455.12,"we have a more comfortable sample size"
3dNZA5YivtA,457.039,"let's just let them figure out their"
3dNZA5YivtA,458.639,"surroundings and we'll check back into"
3dNZA5YivtA,460.479,"them later don't let me down you 185"
3dNZA5YivtA,463.28,"beasts"
3dNZA5YivtA,464.77,"[Music]"
3dNZA5YivtA,466.8,"and you let me down it makes me sad to"
3dNZA5YivtA,468.96,"only see 125 beasts but who doesn't like"
3dNZA5YivtA,471.599,"29 000 deaths i mean i did give him 35"
3dNZA5YivtA,474.879,"000 years to sort this out so i guess"
3dNZA5YivtA,476.8,"this is what nature's equilibrium looks"
3dNZA5YivtA,478.56,"like we've still got our buffalo but"
3dNZA5YivtA,480.319,"also some cows and monkeys and that"
3dNZA5YivtA,483.12,"appears to be it my god did you know"
3dNZA5YivtA,484.96,"that cows can live to be 145 and that"
3dNZA5YivtA,487.68,"buffaloes can become 202 my goodness the"
3dNZA5YivtA,490.56,"things you must have seen"
3dNZA5YivtA,494.319,"well i guess that's all past tense now"
3dNZA5YivtA,496.4,"since you went behind that tree and died"
3dNZA5YivtA,498.319,"we did it we found the perfect circle of"
3dNZA5YivtA,500.4,"animal life so let's screw with it some"
3dNZA5YivtA,502.16,"more i believe this is the savannah"
3dNZA5YivtA,504.08,"biome which is known for being hot so"
3dNZA5YivtA,506.24,"let's see how it deals with a"
3dNZA5YivtA,507.36,"grassland's biome we'll just go ahead"
3dNZA5YivtA,509.199,"and do a nice sprinkling of seeds now"
3dNZA5YivtA,511.12,"the savannah parts look like slices of"
3dNZA5YivtA,512.959,"pizza oh this is exciting we can"
3dNZA5YivtA,514.719,"actually watch as the biomes fight over"
3dNZA5YivtA,516.32,"the land ah look at nature fighting over"
3dNZA5YivtA,518.64,"this like a giant petri dish kinda seems"
3dNZA5YivtA,521.12,"like the grasslands are taking over so"
3dNZA5YivtA,522.88,"it sounds like we should probably"
3dNZA5YivtA,524.08,"introduce the most dangerous of prey"
3dNZA5YivtA,526.08,"human beings besides humans we do have"
3dNZA5YivtA,528.32,"other varieties like elves and dwarves"
3dNZA5YivtA,531.12,"and orcs but we're gonna go basic for"
3dNZA5YivtA,532.88,"now with good old basic humans with"
3dNZA5YivtA,534.8,"basic needs we're just gonna put five of"
3dNZA5YivtA,536.72,"you down right in the middle okay play"
3dNZA5YivtA,538.88,"nice and before long they've got tools"
3dNZA5YivtA,540.959,"they've already harvested some wood and"
3dNZA5YivtA,542.56,"now they're taking that wood and i don't"
3dNZA5YivtA,544.24,"know what i just saw why can't you"
3dNZA5YivtA,546.0,"people leave that buffalo alone it's 93"
3dNZA5YivtA,548.56,"years old leave it alone oh and this"
3dNZA5YivtA,550.64,"one's so excited to work she can barely"
3dNZA5YivtA,552.399,"hold on to her head it's so creepy yet"
3dNZA5YivtA,554.8,"perfect sure didn't take long for them"
3dNZA5YivtA,556.399,"to build civilization did it they've"
3dNZA5YivtA,557.92,"already built themselves a little tent"
3dNZA5YivtA,559.44,"and a fire which the cows seem to really"
3dNZA5YivtA,561.68,"love a little too much so far they're"
3dNZA5YivtA,563.92,"all in the same little group you can"
3dNZA5YivtA,565.279,"tell because they're all wearing blue"
3dNZA5YivtA,566.88,"like this one that's just like mario if"
3dNZA5YivtA,568.72,"mario were shirtless underneath"
3dNZA5YivtA,570.72,"oh hey look a rhino i thought you went"
3dNZA5YivtA,572.56,"extinct hey guys you might want to be"
3dNZA5YivtA,574.08,"careful they look a little tough"
3dNZA5YivtA,576.399,"see what did i tell you and you too and"
3dNZA5YivtA,578.72,"you and you well i bet you guys feel"
3dNZA5YivtA,581.12,"stupid you just died to a rhino that's"
3dNZA5YivtA,583.0,"133 years old which means it's all up to"
3dNZA5YivtA,585.519,"you headless lady now you're not gonna"
3dNZA5YivtA,587.12,"do something dumb like attack that rhino"
3dNZA5YivtA,588.959,"are you you know why am i surprised"
3dNZA5YivtA,591.2,"welp i guess the blue people have been"
3dNZA5YivtA,592.8,"defeated by their mortal enemy the rhino"
3dNZA5YivtA,595.76,"oh nature you're so strong"
3dNZA5YivtA,599.68,"see there you go you could have just"
3dNZA5YivtA,601.12,"left it alone and time would have taken"
3dNZA5YivtA,603.04,"care of it i think that might have been"
3dNZA5YivtA,604.48,"the last one so let's go ahead and try"
3dNZA5YivtA,606.0,"that again we're still only doing five"
3dNZA5YivtA,607.68,"people they need to figure out how to"
3dNZA5YivtA,608.72,"make this work okay so they're off doing"
3dNZA5YivtA,610.48,"their thing flying fields making a big"
3dNZA5YivtA,612.88,"fire oh and look they've got fancy"
3dNZA5YivtA,614.8,"shirts now they're ready to go to the"
3dNZA5YivtA,616.399,"office and while they're doing their"
3dNZA5YivtA,617.68,"thing let's go ahead and check out some"
3dNZA5YivtA,619.04,"of their kingdom info so far we have one"
3dNZA5YivtA,621.12,"kingdom the sockish well let's change"
3dNZA5YivtA,623.519,"that second chance failures yeah i like"
3dNZA5YivtA,626.88,"that a lot more and let's change the"
3dNZA5YivtA,628.48,"pre-made slogan our ancestors sucked and"
3dNZA5YivtA,631.92,"we probably suck but we'll do our best"
3dNZA5YivtA,635.36,"to see if okay that's as far as it lets"
3dNZA5YivtA,637.6,"us type our ancestors sucked and we"
3dNZA5YivtA,639.279,"probably suck but we'll do our best to"
3dNZA5YivtA,641.12,"see absolutely perfect i wish them all"
3dNZA5YivtA,643.36,"the best oh i also forgot to mention but"
3dNZA5YivtA,645.279,"i named this whole area failureville i"
3dNZA5YivtA,647.44,"don't know it felt appropriate it seems"
3dNZA5YivtA,648.959,"like this might be going better the"
3dNZA5YivtA,650.079,"second time mostly because there's no"
3dNZA5YivtA,651.839,"single one rhino to just ruin everybody"
3dNZA5YivtA,654.24,"so basically what happens is over time"
3dNZA5YivtA,656.0,"they start to develop their own"
3dNZA5YivtA,657.12,"civilization their tents are slowly"
3dNZA5YivtA,659.04,"turning into houses they've started to"
3dNZA5YivtA,660.64,"have children of their own and"
3dNZA5YivtA,662.079,"civilization grows and grows and what a"
3dNZA5YivtA,664.64,"nice harmonious life we already have 24"
3dNZA5YivtA,667.04,"people i got an idea it's the year 36"
3dNZA5YivtA,670.0,"944 that means in 56 years 37 000 let's"
3dNZA5YivtA,674.079,"check back in with them then and see how"
3dNZA5YivtA,675.68,"they're doing and there we are well look"
3dNZA5YivtA,677.76,"at that we have all these little houses"
3dNZA5YivtA,679.44,"we even have whatever the hell this is"
3dNZA5YivtA,681.36,"obviously a ski lodge oh boy and look"
3dNZA5YivtA,684.0,"apparently we have a standing army nice"
3dNZA5YivtA,686.079,"weapons you dorks oh my god they're"
3dNZA5YivtA,687.92,"actually wielding sticks created by viru"
3dNZA5YivtA,690.56,"from second chance failures 27 years ago"
3dNZA5YivtA,693.519,"oh yes the family stick passed down"
3dNZA5YivtA,695.76,"through generations of second chance"
3dNZA5YivtA,697.6,"failures they're not all like this"
3dNZA5YivtA,699.12,"though look this one has a wooden sword"
3dNZA5YivtA,701.36,"rare weapon"
3dNZA5YivtA,702.8,"yeah keep telling yourself that that"
3dNZA5YivtA,704.48,"definitely wasn't a lie your parents"
3dNZA5YivtA,706.32,"told you and what's with the shield over"
3dNZA5YivtA,707.839,"this guy's head why is he so special"
3dNZA5YivtA,709.6,"besides the fact that their traits"
3dNZA5YivtA,710.959,"appear to be slow and ugly but your"
3dNZA5YivtA,713.68,"favorite food is sushi so you're a"
3dNZA5YivtA,715.279,"winner in my book i think they must run"
3dNZA5YivtA,717.12,"the army that's my assumption does that"
3dNZA5YivtA,718.8,"mean they follow this person around i"
3dNZA5YivtA,720.56,"think they do you think what i'm"
3dNZA5YivtA,722.32,"thinking and does that have anything to"
3dNZA5YivtA,723.839,"do with this tool i certainly hope so"
3dNZA5YivtA,725.76,"cause that's what we're doing divine"
3dNZA5YivtA,727.44,"magnet grabs creatures to be dropped"
3dNZA5YivtA,729.519,"somewhere else all right everyone move i"
3dNZA5YivtA,731.279,"want to take just the one guy don't try"
3dNZA5YivtA,732.959,"to hide behind a tree it's not going to"

3dNZA5YivtA,860.24,"is nice that it goes and picks people up"
3dNZA5YivtA,861.92,"can't beat that service now what happens"

3dNZA5YivtA,866.079,"the boat just sits here for many many"
3dNZA5YivtA,868.24,"months because realistically that's how"
3dNZA5YivtA,869.92,"long it took for this dude to walk up to"
3dNZA5YivtA,871.519,"the boat anyway and then it just sits"

3dNZA5YivtA,893.199,"well this is all fine and dandy but we"
3dNZA5YivtA,895.12,"really need to give them something to do"
3dNZA5YivtA,896.72,"just look how bored they are you know"
3dNZA5YivtA,898.56,"i've got an idea let's build another"
3dNZA5YivtA,900.56,"civilization and let's build it right"
3dNZA5YivtA,902.8,"around this one and because the village"
3dNZA5YivtA,904.56,"in the center has a head start we're"
3dNZA5YivtA,905.92,"gonna give them some extra people a lot"

3dNZA5YivtA,923.76,"villagers which means that out here"
3dNZA5YivtA,925.519,"there's about 15 000 people of which"
3dNZA5YivtA,927.839,"most of them are on this little square"
3dNZA5YivtA,929.68,"right here unpause oh yeah there they go"

3RUO9cYglC0,374.56,"two things operated it looked like it"
3RUO9cYglC0,377.039,"was poorly coached and poorly motivated"

3RUO9cYglC0,382.319,"get him out of my sight"

3RUO9cYglC0,388.88,"he often has during this past regular"
3RUO9cYglC0,391.28,"season looked like he deserved about"

3RUO9cYglC0,395.84,"yes his qbr was"
3RUO9cYglC0,397.72,"27 after he had averaged a 77 qbr in his"
3RUO9cYglC0,402.8,"previous three playoff games which i"
3RUO9cYglC0,404.88,"thought was extraordinary and i banked"
3RUO9cYglC0,407.52,"on that and when i tried to take his 75"
3RUO9cYglC0,410.319,"million to my playoff bank yesterday"
3RUO9cYglC0,414.96,"the check bounced"
3RUO9cYglC0,416.8,"and he bounced me right out of the"
3RUO9cYglC0,419.039,"playoffs and you say they had to go home"
3RUO9cYglC0,420.96,"they were at home they lost a home"
3RUO9cYglC0,423.52,"playoff game to a 49ers team that they"
3RUO9cYglC0,426.72,"are better than and by the way i tweeted"
3RUO9cYglC0,429.28,"this late in the first half and i'm just"
3RUO9cYglC0,431.28,"going to read it again just to drive"
3RUO9cYglC0,432.88,"home all your points why does this team"
3RUO9cYglC0,435.52,"always do this to me in big games come"
3RUO9cYglC0,438.72,"out deadheaded and fall hopelessly"
3RUO9cYglC0,441.68,"behind it happens every single big game"
3RUO9cYglC0,444.88,"they look overwhelmed they look over"
3RUO9cYglC0,446.88,"matched and for now this is late in the"
3RUO9cYglC0,449.44,"first half they look overrated just"
3RUO9cYglC0,452.16,"makes me want to puke"
3RUO9cYglC0,454.639,"this is about to be over and it should"
3RUO9cYglC0,456.88,"have been over at 23 to 7 down as they"
3RUO9cYglC0,460.479,"entered the fourth quarter but what does"
3RUO9cYglC0,462.8,"rain dakota prescott always do shannon"
3RUO9cYglC0,465.68,"sharp"
3RUO9cYglC0,467.52,"he stinks it up for three quarters and"
3RUO9cYglC0,469.84,"then all of a sudden he goes warrior"
3RUO9cYglC0,472.24,"it's always too little too late but all"
3RUO9cYglC0,474.479,"of a sudden he snaps out of it and snaps"
3RUO9cYglC0,477.44,"into it and in the fourth quarter he was"
3RUO9cYglC0,480.08,"really good my defense was really good"
3RUO9cYglC0,482.319,"in the fourth quarter because in the"
3RUO9cYglC0,483.919,"second half we outscored the 49ers 10 to"
3RUO9cYglC0,487.28,"7 which is what we should have done in"
3RUO9cYglC0,489.039,"the first half but we were not ready to"
3RUO9cYglC0,491.44,"play in the 49ers as you know we won the"
3RUO9cYglC0,494.16,"toss and we deferred because we got a"
3RUO9cYglC0,496.08,"big bad defense no you don't just take"
3RUO9cYglC0,499.52,"the football and cram it right down"
3RUO9cYglC0,501.84,"their throats stick it in the end zone"
3RUO9cYglC0,504.24,"because they've got a running game you"
3RUO9cYglC0,506.08,"cannot stop so take the ball and do what"
3RUO9cYglC0,508.96,"you do best which is move and score the"
3RUO9cYglC0,511.68,"football you go ahead seven to nothing"
3RUO9cYglC0,513.919,"and maybe you would"
3RUO9cYglC0,515.599,"have the advantage for the entire game"
3RUO9cYglC0,517.36,"and instead you're playing out of a hole"
3RUO9cYglC0,519.279,"as we always have to play out of a hole"
3RUO9cYglC0,521.76,"but here we came in the fourth quarter"
3RUO9cYglC0,524.32,"we buckled down on defense and and we"
3RUO9cYglC0,526.88,"started to click on offense would you"
3RUO9cYglC0,529.36,"believe dak prescott threw for 111 yards"
3RUO9cYglC0,532.16,"in the fourth quarter alone he had 143"
3RUO9cYglC0,534.8,"for the first three quarters and right"
3RUO9cYglC0,536.48,"on schedule he had 111. glory be put him"
3RUO9cYglC0,540.64,"in the hall of fame the fourth quarter"
3RUO9cYglC0,542.88,"hall of fame the losers hall of fame"
3RUO9cYglC0,545.12,"okay so shannon sharp we had no business"
3RUO9cYglC0,547.68,"being back in this game but there was a"
3RUO9cYglC0,549.92,"fake pun obviously"
3RUO9cYglC0,551.76,"and and then this happened and that"
3RUO9cYglC0,553.2,"happened and this happened and that"
3RUO9cYglC0,554.399,"happened i'll get to all that in just a"
3RUO9cYglC0,555.839,"minute but when i least expected it when"
3RUO9cYglC0,558.88,"i'll be the first to admit i had"
3RUO9cYglC0,560.32,"completely given up on this game"
3RUO9cYglC0,562.72,"i look up and they actually have a"
3RUO9cYglC0,565.6,"chance and it comes down to one play and"
3RUO9cYglC0,568.72,"it is now time for me to talk about"
3RUO9cYglC0,571.12,"ramon george i never thought i'd be"
3RUO9cYglC0,572.959,"talking about somebody named ramon"
3RUO9cYglC0,574.72,"george to lead off undisputed on a big"
3RUO9cYglC0,578.08,"wild card playoff monday but i'm going"
3RUO9cYglC0,580.8,"to talk about ramon george as in rg4"
3RUO9cYglC0,584.16,"because rg4 should have had us with four"
3RUO9cYglC0,586.959,"seconds left on the clock on the last"
3RUO9cYglC0,588.72,"play so here we go and you can debate"
3RUO9cYglC0,591.279,"whether it should have been a"
3RUO9cYglC0,592.16,"quarterback draw but me just personally"
3RUO9cYglC0,594.88,"i don't know if mike called it i don't"
3RUO9cYglC0,596.32,"know if kellen moore called it i like it"
3RUO9cYglC0,598.72,"actually because the middle of the field"
3RUO9cYglC0,600.32,"was wide open for the quarterback draw"
3RUO9cYglC0,602.64,"you you have a plate clock in your head"
3RUO9cYglC0,604.959,"they call it a church clock i have no"
3RUO9cYglC0,606.959,"i've never heard of that so here we go"
3RUO9cYglC0,608.48,"dax runner it down the middle you"
3RUO9cYglC0,610.32,"obviously have to get down in time to"
3RUO9cYglC0,613.2,"give the umpire time to catch up with"
3RUO9cYglC0,615.44,"the play and spot the football i thought"
3RUO9cYglC0,618.0,"ramon george this umpire in question was"
3RUO9cYglC0,620.959,"late getting to the play"
3RUO9cYglC0,623.44,"and again"
3RUO9cYglC0,624.88,"is he qualified to run with dak prescott"
3RUO9cYglC0,627.2,"you got to come on a dead sprint because"
3RUO9cYglC0,628.959,"the game is about to be over it's up to"
3RUO9cYglC0,631.12,"you sir to get to the football as"
3RUO9cYglC0,633.76,"quickly as they get to the football"
3RUO9cYglC0,635.44,"because they were ready they were in"
3RUO9cYglC0,637.839,"possession yeah but but he got a late"
3RUO9cYglC0,640.16,"start and i thought he was just late to"
3RUO9cYglC0,642.959,"the play and not only was he late to the"
3RUO9cYglC0,645.2,"play he bowls over my quarterback trying"
3RUO9cYglC0,647.92,"to get to the football which is"
3RUO9cYglC0,649.76,"absolutely hysterically sad you got to"
3RUO9cYglC0,652.959,"let him get through him"
3RUO9cYglC0,655.36,"knocking the quarterback over he's"
3RUO9cYglC0,657.2,"pushing biatish the center out of the"
3RUO9cYglC0,659.279,"way to get to the football all he needs"
3RUO9cYglC0,661.36,"to do is touch the football live that's"
3RUO9cYglC0,663.68,"all you need is just a touch okay he"
3RUO9cYglC0,665.68,"wanted to kind of re-spot it back a yard"
3RUO9cYglC0,668.24,"okay that that's his fault for being"
3RUO9cYglC0,670.72,"late to the play because we were in"
3RUO9cYglC0,672.64,"position to have four seconds left on"
3RUO9cYglC0,675.279,"the clock plenty of time to spike the"
3RUO9cYglC0,677.839,"football and stop the clock and then we"
3RUO9cYglC0,680.399,"would have had one shot at the end zone"
3RUO9cYglC0,682.48,"from 24 yards away and i do agree with"
3RUO9cYglC0,684.88,"one thing mike mccarthy said after the"
3RUO9cYglC0,687.12,"game and that was would you rather try a"
3RUO9cYglC0,689.6,"hail mary from 51 yards away or"
3RUO9cYglC0,692.8,"five verticals meaning that everybody"
3RUO9cYglC0,694.8,"just runs go to the end zone five"
3RUO9cYglC0,696.64,"receivers out"
3RUO9cYglC0,698.24,"from the 24-yard line well i'll take it"
3RUO9cYglC0,700.24,"from the 24-yard line because we saw"
3RUO9cYglC0,702.8,"what dak did earlier in the game in the"
3RUO9cYglC0,704.72,"second quarter from 20 yards away he had"
3RUO9cYglC0,706.64,"amari with the sweet throw that was his"
3RUO9cYglC0,708.32,"best store of the game you could argue"
3RUO9cYglC0,710.0,"his only good throw of the game for a"
3RUO9cYglC0,711.839,"touchdown so my point is that look we"
3RUO9cYglC0,714.72,"see him he's just so late to the play he"
3RUO9cYglC0,716.88,"got a late start you need to be trailing"
3RUO9cYglC0,719.12,"to play because the game is about to end"
3RUO9cYglC0,722.32,"you have to give us a last second chance"
3RUO9cYglC0,725.68,"for a miracle steal of the game and"
3RUO9cYglC0,728.32,"again it would have been a miracle we"
3RUO9cYglC0,729.839,"would have stolen the game but would i"
3RUO9cYglC0,732.24,"completely bet against dak prescott"
3RUO9cYglC0,734.639,"finding somebody open in the end zone"
3RUO9cYglC0,736.88,"for a last-second touchdown pass that's"
3RUO9cYglC0,739.04,"what he does that he he's better at that"
3RUO9cYglC0,741.519,"than the first three quarters of the"
3RUO9cYglC0,742.959,"game go ahead"
3RUO9cYglC0,745.519,"but let me ask you a question skip"
3RUO9cYglC0,747.36,"mike mccarthy and dak prescott say they"
3RUO9cYglC0,749.2,"practice display during the game i mean"
3RUO9cYglC0,750.959,"during the practice when you practice"
3RUO9cYglC0,752.8,"that play do you have an official there"
3RUO9cYglC0,754.399,"to spot the ball or are you just having"
3RUO9cYglC0,756.399,"your guy run the ball back and to the"
3RUO9cYglC0,758.399,"center you know the umpire so now you're"
3RUO9cYglC0,761.44,"asking the umpire to do something that"
3RUO9cYglC0,763.519,"he doesn't do in any other games"
3RUO9cYglC0,765.44,"immediately once the guy starts running"
3RUO9cYglC0,767.76,"starts trailing the play you know they"
3RUO9cYglC0,769.76,"don't do that stop asking for something"
3RUO9cYglC0,771.92,"special in this game that officials"
3RUO9cYglC0,774.079,"don't do in any other game and like"
3RUO9cYglC0,776.24,"jerry said we're gonna get to what jerry"
3RUO9cYglC0,777.839,"said jerry says i'm not gonna criticize"
3RUO9cYglC0,780.56,"the official because i'm looking at my"
3RUO9cYglC0,782.48,"personnel why are we why are we even in"
3RUO9cYglC0,785.92,"that position"
3RUO9cYglC0,788.24,"again"
3RUO9cYglC0,789.76,"he would not make that"
3RUO9cYglC0,791.2,"the game"
3RUO9cYglC0,793.2,"right skip but but here's the thing did"
3RUO9cYglC0,796.72,"the game not go the way i laid it out i"
3RUO9cYglC0,799.76,"say skip they're going to be able to run"
3RUO9cYglC0,801.04,"the ball because they'll be able to"
3RUO9cYglC0,802.48,"attack all areas of the field with the"
3RUO9cYglC0,804.079,"running game me personally i believe"
3RUO9cYglC0,806.56,"kyle can dial up the running game better"
3RUO9cYglC0,808.88,"than his father because he can attack"
3RUO9cYglC0,811.44,"areas of the field that we can only"
3RUO9cYglC0,812.88,"attack with td he could attack those"
3RUO9cYglC0,815.12,"same areas of the field not only with"
3RUO9cYglC0,817.279,"his running back elijah mitchell but he"
3RUO9cYglC0,819.279,"can do it with demo samuels he can do it"
3RUO9cYglC0,821.519,"with brandon nyuk so he has ways to"
3RUO9cYglC0,824.0,"attack the field in the running game"
3RUO9cYglC0,825.68,"that we never could skip and you know we"
3RUO9cYglC0,827.76,"could run the football back in the mid"
3RUO9cYglC0,829.199,"90s with terrell davis and i said skip"
3RUO9cYglC0,832.48,"they'll be able to get to your"
3RUO9cYglC0,833.76,"quarterback with their front four"
3RUO9cYglC0,835.92,"without having to sacrifice their back"
3RUO9cYglC0,837.76,"end the thing that helped you is when"
3RUO9cYglC0,839.92,"joy when uh nick bowser went down when"
3RUO9cYglC0,842.72,"nick bolson was in there he gave log"
3RUO9cYglC0,844.959,"callers all he can handle the other guy"
3RUO9cYglC0,847.519,"was giving tyrant smith all he could"
3RUO9cYglC0,849.519,"handle armstead was giving connor"
3RUO9cYglC0,851.92,"williams all he can handle so when you"
3RUO9cYglC0,854.88,"look at it the game played out like i"
3RUO9cYglC0,857.279,"thought it would"
3RUO9cYglC0,858.56,"and one thing and you keep talking about"
3RUO9cYglC0,860.16,"the penalties skill when you see the"
3RUO9cYglC0,862.56,"defensive holding penalty that got"
3RUO9cYglC0,864.959,"called"
3RUO9cYglC0,865.92,"they alerted the officials they had seen"
3RUO9cYglC0,868.32,"something on tape that happened over a"
3RUO9cYglC0,870.639,"period of time that says watch 96 watch"
3RUO9cYglC0,874.16,"94 because what i know the 49ers do a"
3RUO9cYglC0,877.12,"great job of because bobby turner is the"
3RUO9cYglC0,878.959,"running back coach there he was with me"
3RUO9cYglC0,881.04,"in denver and a lot of the offensive"
3RUO9cYglC0,882.56,"principles remain the same in that zone"
3RUO9cYglC0,884.639,"running scheme skill i don't want to get"
3RUO9cYglC0,886.639,"too complicated tech but they do a lot"
3RUO9cYglC0,888.8,"of scoop blocking basically they take"
3RUO9cYglC0,890.72,"two linemen or a diamond in a tight end"
3RUO9cYglC0,892.88,"and they scoop up to try to get to a"
3RUO9cYglC0,894.32,"linebacker or they try to get to the"
3RUO9cYglC0,896.24,"second level and the defensive lineman"
3RUO9cYglC0,898.32,"hold so the guy can get over the top and"
3RUO9cYglC0,900.399,"make the play they alerted the umpire"
3RUO9cYglC0,902.8,"they are loved alerted back judge watch"
3RUO9cYglC0,905.36,"this they do a lot of this and we saw it"
3RUO9cYglC0,907.76,"i saw it called three times and i might"
3RUO9cYglC0,909.92,"have thought it saw it called three"
3RUO9cYglC0,911.279,"times all season long but the game"
3RUO9cYglC0,913.44,"played out like i thought it would"
3RUO9cYglC0,916.32,"yeah did you think that my defense would"
3RUO9cYglC0,918.639,"hold san francisco to a mere 138 total"

3RUO9cYglC0,958.399,"holding them to field goals or that game"

3RUO9cYglC0,1049.84,"quarter to cd lamb who was a no-show"
3RUO9cYglC0,1052.08,"yesterday because dak has no rapport"

3RUO9cYglC0,1056.4,"if we could see the throw to cd oh i'm"

3RUO9cYglC0,1085.12,"because he's not very good okay so i got"
3RUO9cYglC0,1087.679,"that okay so then the classic was"
3RUO9cYglC0,1090.24,"because we deferred"
3RUO9cYglC0,1092.0,"after we won the opening toss we got the"
3RUO9cYglC0,1094.16,"ball to start the second half so we're"
3RUO9cYglC0,1095.76,"down 16 to seven i'm thinking okay"
3RUO9cYglC0,1098.16,"let's go let's go stick it in the end"
3RUO9cYglC0,1099.84,"zone it'll be 16 to 14. we'll have a"
3RUO9cYglC0,1101.6,"ball game and it immediately gets to"
3RUO9cYglC0,1103.919,"third and four at the 31-yard line and"
3RUO9cYglC0,1106.24,"what do we do in back-to-back plays"
3RUO9cYglC0,1108.32,"would you believe we go false start and"
3RUO9cYglC0,1111.52,"false start"
3RUO9cYglC0,1112.799,"how can you go false start false start"
3RUO9cYglC0,1114.799,"it's it it that's bad football team"
3RUO9cYglC0,1118.72,"that's poorly coached football team here"
3RUO9cYglC0,1121.2,"we are false start guess who it was my"
3RUO9cYglC0,1124.16,"entire left side my"
3RUO9cYglC0,1125.919,"yeah it was my"

3RUO9cYglC0,1128.96,"come right back again and we go false"
3RUO9cYglC0,1130.64,"start again"
3RUO9cYglC0,1132.0,"on just about everybody"
3RUO9cYglC0,1134.24,"it it's"
3RUO9cYglC0,1135.679,"that's that's the sign of a bad football"
3RUO9cYglC0,1138.4,"team which which leads to this so so we"
3RUO9cYglC0,1141.039,"had one chance this is what we've been"
3RUO9cYglC0,1142.88,"doing all year as you well know we led"
3RUO9cYglC0,1144.559,"the league in takeaways if we could see"
3RUO9cYglC0,1146.72,"the kazee play this is later in the"
3RUO9cYglC0,1148.799,"third quarter this is with about uh"
3RUO9cYglC0,1152.96,"what is it 8 39 left in the third"
3RUO9cYglC0,1155.76,"quarter if we could see what happens uh"
3RUO9cYglC0,1158.16,"curse tips a jimmy g throw and and i"
3RUO9cYglC0,1160.559,"thought you know what this could be big"
3RUO9cYglC0,1162.88,"time this could go"
3RUO9cYglC0,1164.48,"this this is where you take the game"
3RUO9cYglC0,1166.08,"over the ball gets tipped up in the air"
3RUO9cYglC0,1168.16,"and it hits kazee right on top of the"
3RUO9cYglC0,1171.039,"helmet well well that's the kind of play"
3RUO9cYglC0,1173.36,"we've been making all year long you can"
3RUO9cYglC0,1175.28,"see it hits him right on top of the"
3RUO9cYglC0,1176.4,"helmet if he catches that"
3RUO9cYglC0,1178.4,"i i'm i'm here to tell you i think we"
3RUO9cYglC0,1180.4,"win the game because i think the"
3RUO9cYglC0,1181.76,"momentum shifts seismically at that"
3RUO9cYglC0,1184.16,"point and we just it was one of those"
3RUO9cYglC0,1186.08,"days we did not make the play"
3RUO9cYglC0,1189.44,"okay so then we got the jimmy g"
3RUO9cYglC0,1191.2,"interception in the fourth quarter which"
3RUO9cYglC0,1192.799,"turns the game around and then it comes"
3RUO9cYglC0,1195.039,"down to"
3RUO9cYglC0,1196.72,"there's a third and twelve play"
3RUO9cYglC0,1198.96,"at the 37 yard line"
3RUO9cYglC0,1201.44,"with 436 left in the game and and this"
3RUO9cYglC0,1204.08,"is a huge because"
3RUO9cYglC0,1205.84,"this is this is a big throw big"
3RUO9cYglC0,1207.76,"completion and it looked like we were"
3RUO9cYglC0,1210.64,"about to take it home again if we could"
3RUO9cYglC0,1212.48,"see this play because neville gallimore"
3RUO9cYglC0,1215.44,"gets illegal hands to the face this is"
3RUO9cYglC0,1217.919,"third and 12th for the 49ers and it"
3RUO9cYglC0,1219.6,"looked like oh we almost intercepted it"
3RUO9cYglC0,1221.44,"and i thought here we go because they're"
3RUO9cYglC0,1222.64,"going to have to pond nope neville"
3RUO9cYglC0,1224.799,"gallimore has hands to the face it's"
3RUO9cYglC0,1227.12,"huge it's just huge okay"
3RUO9cYglC0,1229.84,"it's poorly coached bad football and"
3RUO9cYglC0,1233.039,"again i blame that ultimately on the"
3RUO9cYglC0,1235.919,"quote-unquote head coach drop the mike"
3RUO9cYglC0,1238.24,"mccarthy okay so"
3RUO9cYglC0,1240.88,"now we've got"
3RUO9cYglC0,1243.2,"we go down to the the fourth down play"
3RUO9cYglC0,1245.6,"where we got the false start"
3RUO9cYglC0,1247.679,"on as you know on um trent williams"
3RUO9cYglC0,1252.0,"then then we come to that's on jimmy g"
3RUO9cYglC0,1253.76,"and then we got to let him get set"
3RUO9cYglC0,1254.88,"that's from jimmy g"
3RUO9cYglC0,1256.72,"yeah and could we see the one last"
3RUO9cYglC0,1258.96,"penalty if we could on randy gregory"
3RUO9cYglC0,1260.88,"please because"
3RUO9cYglC0,1262.799,"there's the the jimmy g"
3RUO9cYglC0,1265.2,"gets stuck and it's"
3RUO9cYglC0,1267.039,"but if we could see this last play on on"
3RUO9cYglC0,1269.6,"randy gregory this is the worst penalty"
3RUO9cYglC0,1272.08,"of the game"
3RUO9cYglC0,1273.76,"this this costs us more time because"
3RUO9cYglC0,1275.679,"randy gregory i don't know what he's"
3RUO9cYglC0,1277.44,"doing but but he gets upset with the guy"
3RUO9cYglC0,1279.6,"who's blocking him and he decides to"
3RUO9cYglC0,1281.679,"tackle him if we could see this please"
3RUO9cYglC0,1286.159,"he tackles his guy he tackles him what"
3RUO9cYglC0,1289.36,"what is he doing and it's just an"
3RUO9cYglC0,1291.679,"outrage"
3RUO9cYglC0,1292.88,"again that's bad football by a bad"
3RUO9cYglC0,1295.6,"football team so it's hard for me to"
3RUO9cYglC0,1297.52,"justify any of this because i'm saying"
3RUO9cYglC0,1299.6,"what what was that so you keep costing"
3RUO9cYglC0,1302.32,"yourself time because the neville"
3RUO9cYglC0,1304.24,"gallimore play cost us two clock minutes"
3RUO9cYglC0,1306.96,"and this cost us more time and and yet"
3RUO9cYglC0,1310.0,"right"
3RUO9cYglC0,1310.88,"we we wind up with what was it like 32"
3RUO9cYglC0,1313.76,"seconds left we finally get the ball"
3RUO9cYglC0,1315.76,"back and to dak's credit as dak always"
3RUO9cYglC0,1318.159,"does you call him garbage yards but he"
3RUO9cYglC0,1320.72,"padded his stats by at least getting us"
3RUO9cYglC0,1323.28,"in position"
3RUO9cYglC0,1324.72,"to make the last play and my man ramon"
3RUO9cYglC0,1328.24,"george"
3RUO9cYglC0,1329.28,"actually tackles my quarterback and"
3RUO9cYglC0,1331.28,"disrupts the last play so any hope i had"
3RUO9cYglC0,1334.24,"of a miraculous steal of a victory at"
3RUO9cYglC0,1336.64,"the end of the game as we see here"
3RUO9cYglC0,1339.919,"it got deleted by"
3RUO9cYglC0,1342.559,"the umpire and as mike mccarthy said he"
3RUO9cYglC0,1346.0,"expected them to at least review it and"
3RUO9cYglC0,1348.159,"maybe put a couple seconds back on the"
3RUO9cYglC0,1349.76,"clock no and for some reason the head"
3RUO9cYglC0,1351.76,"referee just said the game is over why"
3RUO9cYglC0,1353.84,"would the game be why don't you review"
3RUO9cYglC0,1355.52,"that why don't you go check clock versus"
3RUO9cYglC0,1358.32,"what what your umpire botched in in the"
3RUO9cYglC0,1361.52,"end i i at least deserve one last shot"
3RUO9cYglC0,1364.48,"to rectify all of the junk that we just"
3RUO9cYglC0,1366.88,"talked about"
3RUO9cYglC0,1370.72,"but here's the thing though skip"
3RUO9cYglC0,1372.72,"and all those 14 penalties do you"
3RUO9cYglC0,1375.12,"believe any of those penalties were"
3RUO9cYglC0,1377.039,"without merit you just showed the randy"
3RUO9cYglC0,1379.679,"gregory you just showed the naval gala"
3RUO9cYglC0,1381.44,"morning gallimore got two holders i"
3RUO9cYglC0,1383.36,"think randy gray i think neville"
3RUO9cYglC0,1385.12,"gallimore got two i think randy gregor"
3RUO9cYglC0,1386.88,"has one or maybe it was vice versa but"
3RUO9cYglC0,1389.12,"was there any penalty that you thought"
3RUO9cYglC0,1391.2,"the re the referee that the official"
3RUO9cYglC0,1393.039,"threw that will agree just like that's"
3RUO9cYglC0,1394.96,"not a flag if you go back and look at it"
3RUO9cYglC0,1397.2,"all 14 penalties were with merit they"
3RUO9cYglC0,1400.159,"did they they did the act that the"
3RUO9cYglC0,1402.48,"official said they alleged they did so"
3RUO9cYglC0,1404.96,"and for you skip ramon george i get it"
3RUO9cYglC0,1407.44,"skip you make it seem like the guy's"
3RUO9cYglC0,1409.2,"supposed to be tyrique"
3RUO9cYglC0,1410.72,"you do realize these guys are in their"
3RUO9cYglC0,1412.32,"50s and 60s there's this is not their"
3RUO9cYglC0,1414.32,"full-time job they do an outstanding job"
3RUO9cYglC0,1416.799,"yes they miss calls they're human the"
3RUO9cYglC0,1418.64,"human as you said jerry said human"
3RUO9cYglC0,1421.12,"frailties there's a human element in"
3RUO9cYglC0,1423.6,"officiating the guy's running as fast as"
3RUO9cYglC0,1426.08,"he can but you what you have to"
3RUO9cYglC0,1427.76,"understand is that housing suppose just"
3RUO9cYglC0,1430.159,"imagine if he goes all the way around"
3RUO9cYglC0,1432.24,"the left tackle tries to get him to spot"
3RUO9cYglC0,1434.4,"the ball he's trying to do you a favor"
3RUO9cYglC0,1436.64,"he is trying to jump through a crease it"
3RUO9cYglC0,1438.64,"just so happens that the crazy is trying"
3RUO9cYglC0,1440.799,"to"
3RUO9cYglC0,1441.6,"yes decrees that he's trying to jump"
3RUO9cYglC0,1443.76,"through dak was standing there so now he"
3RUO9cYglC0,1445.919,"has to shove his way through tick tick"
3RUO9cYglC0,1448.4,"tick tick tick so for me skip"
3RUO9cYglC0,1452.0,"why are you in this you told me you're"
3RUO9cYglC0,1455.039,"much better than the 49ers if you're"
3RUO9cYglC0,1458.0,"much better than the 49ers i didn't say"
3RUO9cYglC0,1460.0,"that"
3RUO9cYglC0,1463.36,"yeah we're just going to come back we"
3RUO9cYglC0,1464.88,"are we didn't play better we didn't play"
3RUO9cYglC0,1466.72,"better we weren't ready they were ready"
3RUO9cYglC0,1468.159,"to play"
3RUO9cYglC0,1469.2,"and and in the end your point about"
3RUO9cYglC0,1470.96,"ramon george he he's he's about 50 years"
3RUO9cYglC0,1474.0,"old and he works for jp morgan chase and"
3RUO9cYglC0,1476.799,"private banking so you know they're all"
3RUO9cYglC0,1478.96,"part-time i don't know what kind of"
3RUO9cYglC0,1480.88,"condition he's in he doesn't practice"
3RUO9cYglC0,1483.279,"during the week as a referee he has to"
3RUO9cYglC0,1485.2,"fly to a game"
3RUO9cYglC0,1486.48,"each weekend it's a lot to ask him he"
3RUO9cYglC0,1489.2,"was trailing the play and he was late to"
3RUO9cYglC0,1491.84,"do his job it's as simple as that"
3RUO9cYglC0,1495.039,"well skip before they move the umpire"
3RUO9cYglC0,1497.36,"you know the umpire used to be on the"
3RUO9cYglC0,1499.039,"other side of the ball yeah they moved"
3RUO9cYglC0,1501.039,"him to the back where the referee is so"
3RUO9cYglC0,1503.279,"now he's at a disadvantage whereas"
3RUO9cYglC0,1505.279,"before he could turn the play starts he"
3RUO9cYglC0,1507.6,"could turn and trail the play he's"
3RUO9cYglC0,1509.44,"starting from such a distance and i"
3RUO9cYglC0,1511.52,"would like to think there's not an"
3RUO9cYglC0,1513.279,"umpire in the league that should be able"
3RUO9cYglC0,1515.2,"to keep up with a quarterback unless"
3RUO9cYglC0,1517.039,"it's tom brady i would be very offended"

4duWpEFDwjM,11.92,"it's a flavorless spirit so i got the"
4duWpEFDwjM,13.679,"same double bubble gum it took a minute"
4duWpEFDwjM,15.599,"to unwrap it put them into the bottle"
4duWpEFDwjM,17.119,"and fill it up to the top with vodka"
4duWpEFDwjM,19.52,"that infusion didn't take long in 24"

4duWpEFDwjM,33.92,"bubblegum vodka with a bitter tonic"
4duWpEFDwjM,35.92,"water"
4duWpEFDwjM,37.84,"and it was even better in the bubblegum"
4duWpEFDwjM,39.92,"meal so i squeezed a little bit of fresh"
4duWpEFDwjM,41.84,"lime juice and filled it up with the"
4duWpEFDwjM,43.44,"ginger beer"
4duWpEFDwjM,45.68,"since the bubblegum vodka is so sweet"

4eWmr6w0JjM,107.52,"like man it's just too much [ __ ]"
4eWmr6w0JjM,109.759,"there are too many things that you have"
4eWmr6w0JjM,112.32,"to do that are in the way of you just"
4eWmr6w0JjM,115.36,"playing the game"
4eWmr6w0JjM,116.88,"on an optimized level because nobody"
4eWmr6w0JjM,119.36,"wants to play unoptimized nobody wants"
4eWmr6w0JjM,122.24,"to play with a handicap nobody wants to"
4eWmr6w0JjM,124.32,"play like oh i don't have my second"
4eWmr6w0JjM,125.92,"legendary oh i don't have my sockets or"
4eWmr6w0JjM,128.0,"whatever people want to immediately have"
4eWmr6w0JjM,130.08,"that [ __ ] and it's not about like"
4eWmr6w0JjM,131.68,"immediately having it it's about having"
4eWmr6w0JjM,133.92,"a path to getting it that's not so long"
4eWmr6w0JjM,137.68,"that it just makes people give up"
4eWmr6w0JjM,139.44,"because if you make the path so long"
4eWmr6w0JjM,141.84,"there's a lot of people that just think"
4eWmr6w0JjM,143.12,"to themselves that's going to take too"
4eWmr6w0JjM,144.56,"long i don't want to do that it's the"
4eWmr6w0JjM,146.239,"same as like remember back in a day did"
4eWmr6w0JjM,147.84,"any of you guys ever have the experience"
4eWmr6w0JjM,149.36,"where you had like a friend that wanted"
4eWmr6w0JjM,151.04,"to play wow and they were like oh man"
4eWmr6w0JjM,153.44,"but like isn't the level cap like 90 or"
4eWmr6w0JjM,155.36,"100 or something that's gonna take"
4eWmr6w0JjM,156.72,"forever to get to so i don't want to do"
4eWmr6w0JjM,158.8,"it like yeah i i had yeah i had a lot of"
4eWmr6w0JjM,161.68,"people that that would tell me that i'm"
4eWmr6w0JjM,163.2,"like no actually it's the opposite it's"
4eWmr6w0JjM,164.72,"faster than whenever you have to get the"
4eWmr6w0JjM,166.239,"60. and it's like you just wouldn't"
4eWmr6w0JjM,168.16,"expect that so it's the um the"
4eWmr6w0JjM,170.879,"psychology behind it when"
4eWmr6w0JjM,173.12,"if someone's a wow player and they want"
4eWmr6w0JjM,174.64,"to like try out mythic plus and try out"
4eWmr6w0JjM,176.8,"raiding and try out pvp the amount of"
4eWmr6w0JjM,179.28,"[ __ ] they have to do to get to that"
4eWmr6w0JjM,180.8,"point is actually dumb yeah like i"
4eWmr6w0JjM,183.44,"apologize"
4eWmr6w0JjM,184.8,"but it's it's stupid yeah even if they"
4eWmr6w0JjM,187.12,"keep adding alt ketchup there needs to"
4eWmr6w0JjM,189.44,"just be ketchup because some people"
4eWmr6w0JjM,192.4,"don't have alts"
4eWmr6w0JjM,193.92,"some people it's just their main"
4eWmr6w0JjM,195.12,"character and if it's just your main"
4eWmr6w0JjM,196.56,"character you're totally screwed uh so"
4eWmr6w0JjM,199.04,"that's my that's my it's like this is"
4eWmr6w0JjM,200.879,"the same way i feel with like the shards"
4eWmr6w0JjM,202.959,"of domination i don't care about them uh"
4eWmr6w0JjM,205.84,"they're gonna get removed next patch so"
4eWmr6w0JjM,208.239,"like why do i even wanna spend a second"
4eWmr6w0JjM,210.959,"of my time doing it there's no reason"
4eWmr6w0JjM,213.68,"but they don't have to do any of it"
4eWmr6w0JjM,215.04,"what's that youtuber got in the mythic"
4eWmr6w0JjM,216.319,"plus then weeks of fresh character that"
4eWmr6w0JjM,217.84,"feels very reasonable"
4eWmr6w0JjM,219.44,"the reason why he got into it within"
4eWmr6w0JjM,221.84,"weeks of being a fresh character is"
4eWmr6w0JjM,224.0,"because he probably played the game"
4eWmr6w0JjM,225.84,"non-stop"
4eWmr6w0JjM,227.2,"and he knew everything about the game"
4eWmr6w0JjM,229.36,"and how to approach it like he knew"
4eWmr6w0JjM,231.2,"exactly what to do beforehand it's like"
4eWmr6w0JjM,233.599,"a a guy that beats dark souls in a half"
4eWmr6w0JjM,236.159,"hour is not a good indicator of how hard"
4eWmr6w0JjM,239.04,"the game is"
4eWmr6w0JjM,241.04,"i had a i had an experience here's"
4eWmr6w0JjM,243.2,"here's an experience that i had this"
4eWmr6w0JjM,244.879,"alone should be a video like i should"
4eWmr6w0JjM,246.64,"just make a video"
4eWmr6w0JjM,248.08,"and send this to the developers okay"
4eWmr6w0JjM,250.239,"here we go yeah you ready this is what"
4eWmr6w0JjM,252.64,"happened okay here we go let me tell you"
4eWmr6w0JjM,254.56,"guys a little story let's hear it all"
4eWmr6w0JjM,256.079,"right we might actually turn this into a"
4eWmr6w0JjM,257.519,"youtube video or something like that"
4eWmr6w0JjM,258.639,"okay here's a little story for you guys"
4eWmr6w0JjM,260.0,"okay"
4eWmr6w0JjM,260.72,"and this is like this is a situation i"
4eWmr6w0JjM,263.12,"feel like the developers should be made"
4eWmr6w0JjM,265.199,"aware of because"
4eWmr6w0JjM,266.96,"people want to play the game"
4eWmr6w0JjM,270.24,"but they can't okay and obviously saying"
4eWmr6w0JjM,272.4,"that they can't is hyperbole but you"
4eWmr6w0JjM,274.639,"have to understand it's like"
4eWmr6w0JjM,276.4,"this is what is the analogy i like to"
4eWmr6w0JjM,278.08,"use the analogy i like to use is it's"
4eWmr6w0JjM,280.56,"like someone says oh man i want to go uh"
4eWmr6w0JjM,282.8,"for a hike you know what i mean it's"
4eWmr6w0JjM,284.4,"like their first hike they've ever done"
4eWmr6w0JjM,285.52,"in their whole life okay and you dropped"
4eWmr6w0JjM,287.199,"them off at the base of"
4eWmr6w0JjM,289.44,"mount everest okay"
4eWmr6w0JjM,292.0,"you dropped them off at the base of"
4eWmr6w0JjM,293.199,"mount everest"
4eWmr6w0JjM,294.88,"it's just they're gonna give up before"
4eWmr6w0JjM,296.88,"they even try you know what i mean and"
4eWmr6w0JjM,298.88,"that's kind of how it is in wow right"
4eWmr6w0JjM,300.32,"now and the problem is like they uh they"
4eWmr6w0JjM,303.84,"they add in extra things that you have"
4eWmr6w0JjM,306.08,"to do"
4eWmr6w0JjM,307.039,"and then they never make it easier later"
4eWmr6w0JjM,309.52,"on to do them so like uh farming out all"
4eWmr6w0JjM,313.039,"of your honor gear farming out all of"
4eWmr6w0JjM,314.96,"your conquest gear what they should do"
4eWmr6w0JjM,317.52,"is they should look at the amount of"
4eWmr6w0JjM,319.6,"time that it takes to go from zero to"
4eWmr6w0JjM,321.6,"sixty not like the level but like"
4eWmr6w0JjM,324.72,"having no gear to having like the"
4eWmr6w0JjM,327.199,"optimum gear and look at what the time"
4eWmr6w0JjM,330.4,"that it takes is like how many hours"
4eWmr6w0JjM,333.28,"and then base things off of that because"
4eWmr6w0JjM,336.24,"i think if you really went back and you"
4eWmr6w0JjM,338.16,"looked at how much time"
4eWmr6w0JjM,340.4,"it takes your character to become fully"
4eWmr6w0JjM,342.24,"optimized right now in shadow lands"
4eWmr6w0JjM,345.44,"like how much time would you say yeah"
4eWmr6w0JjM,347.919,"how much time would you guys say how"
4eWmr6w0JjM,349.199,"many hours do you think it would take"
4eWmr6w0JjM,351.12,"yeah a hundred hours"
4eWmr6w0JjM,353.28,"uh 200 let's let's let's just go with"
4eWmr6w0JjM,355.759,"100 hours all right how much time did it"
4eWmr6w0JjM,358.639,"take in wod to get all your pvp gear"
4eWmr6w0JjM,361.6,"like minus like those stupid weird"
4eWmr6w0JjM,363.28,"trinkets in ashran uh it would take you"
4eWmr6w0JjM,365.68,"like yeah maybe 20 to 40 hours"
4eWmr6w0JjM,368.639,"i'd say like and it's the same thing"
4eWmr6w0JjM,370.319,"with mists of pandaria"
4eWmr6w0JjM,372.479,"20 to 40 hours of farming"
4eWmr6w0JjM,374.96,"and that's really what the difference is"
4eWmr6w0JjM,377.6,"that's the real difference is the time"
4eWmr6w0JjM,380.319,"is that you are more than doubling the"
4eWmr6w0JjM,382.88,"amount of time that somebody has to"
4eWmr6w0JjM,385.28,"invest into the game and it's actually"
4eWmr6w0JjM,387.759,"very simple like if they want to this is"
4eWmr6w0JjM,390.16,"what i would do if i was a uh"
4eWmr6w0JjM,393.199,"if i was making the game right now"
4eWmr6w0JjM,395.28,"they're addressing the system uh adding"
4eWmr6w0JjM,397.28,"systems that are suffocating the average"
4eWmr6w0JjM,398.8,"player well no exactly the issue is"
4eWmr6w0JjM,401.36,"mandatory tasks are ultimately obsolete"
4eWmr6w0JjM,403.28,"content which will be immediately"
4eWmr6w0JjM,404.56,"replaced"
4eWmr6w0JjM,405.6,"imagine this"
4eWmr6w0JjM,407.039,"imagine if you bought pvp gear"
4eWmr6w0JjM,409.84,"and its pvp scaling went automatically"
4eWmr6w0JjM,413.12,"up to the highest level and its pve"
4eWmr6w0JjM,415.919,"scaling is what you could upgrade"
4eWmr6w0JjM,418.08,"and that way if you wanted to"
4eWmr6w0JjM,419.52,"immediately get into pvp all you had to"
4eWmr6w0JjM,422.08,"do was buy a set of armor and you didn't"
4eWmr6w0JjM,424.24,"have to upgrade it but if you want to"
4eWmr6w0JjM,426.0,"make it relevant in pve as well you can"
4eWmr6w0JjM,428.72,"upgrade it with honor instead so yeah i"
4eWmr6w0JjM,431.919,"can't really imagine why that would be a"
4eWmr6w0JjM,433.68,"bad idea i really don't know yeah that"
4eWmr6w0JjM,436.56,"would be fine yeah just fixed it yeah i"
4eWmr6w0JjM,438.4,"think that would be a pretty good"
4eWmr6w0JjM,439.84,"solution"
4eWmr6w0JjM,441.039,"because like yeah the pvp scaling would"
4eWmr6w0JjM,442.8,"be the exact same and everything would"
4eWmr6w0JjM,444.72,"be fine well i just made the gear"
4eWmr6w0JjM,446.24,"actually fun to get rather than a"
4eWmr6w0JjM,447.44,"necessary step to playing the game"
4eWmr6w0JjM,449.44,"because people are always going to view"
4eWmr6w0JjM,451.28,"it as a necessary step to playing the"
4eWmr6w0JjM,452.96,"game"
4eWmr6w0JjM,453.84,"it's just that you're you're looking for"
4eWmr6w0JjM,455.759,"something that doesn't exist"
4eWmr6w0JjM,457.44,"wouldn't that shorten play time no and"
4eWmr6w0JjM,459.759,"this is what the problem is"
4eWmr6w0JjM,461.52,"is that it's exactly with"
4eWmr6w0JjM,463.36,"what vinrookie is saying with his"
4eWmr6w0JjM,465.039,"analogy"
4eWmr6w0JjM,466.16,"is that if you put somebody let's say"
4eWmr6w0JjM,468.479,"hiking all the way up at mount ezras"
4eWmr6w0JjM,470.24,"takes a week well if somebody just turns"
4eWmr6w0JjM,473.199,"around as soon as they look up at the"
4eWmr6w0JjM,474.879,"mountain then there's no play time at"
4eWmr6w0JjM,477.44,"all and i think there's a lot of people"
4eWmr6w0JjM,479.36,"that look up at the amount of time"
4eWmr6w0JjM,480.96,"you've got to spend"
4eWmr6w0JjM,482.24,"and they don't even try they don't even"
4eWmr6w0JjM,484.639,"try because they know how much time it's"
4eWmr6w0JjM,487.52,"going to take and that's what the issue"
4eWmr6w0JjM,489.36,"is but nobody does that how many of you"
4eWmr6w0JjM,491.52,"guys let me ask you something if it was"
4eWmr6w0JjM,493.759,"easier for you to level let me ask you"
4eWmr6w0JjM,496.479,"how many of you back in uh patch 8.3"
4eWmr6w0JjM,499.52,"would have loved to play alts with"
4eWmr6w0JjM,501.36,"corruptions that were maxed out"
4eWmr6w0JjM,503.52,"but you didn't because of how much time"
4eWmr6w0JjM,505.44,"it took me"
4eWmr6w0JjM,507.039,"and that is my point"
4eWmr6w0JjM,509.68,"that is my [ __ ] point"
4eWmr6w0JjM,512.08,"is that you get to the point where"
4eWmr6w0JjM,514.56,"you are actually minimizing play time"
4eWmr6w0JjM,516.64,"down to zero because you're trying to"
4eWmr6w0JjM,518.8,"maximize it beyond what somebody wants"
4eWmr6w0JjM,520.88,"to invest their time into know that they"
4eWmr6w0JjM,522.959,"added a lot of ketchup stuff for alts"
4eWmr6w0JjM,524.56,"but it's not just alts you have to be"
4eWmr6w0JjM,526.32,"concerned with i think you're just"
4eWmr6w0JjM,527.44,"returning"
4eWmr6w0JjM,529.2,"with getting new players into the game"
4eWmr6w0JjM,530.88,"or people that haven't tried shadow lens"
4eWmr6w0JjM,532.48,"that want to play shadow lands"
4eWmr6w0JjM,534.64,"okay"
4eWmr6w0JjM,535.519,"so this this is a real story i i [ __ ]"
4eWmr6w0JjM,538.08,"you not okay"
4eWmr6w0JjM,540.0,"i was doing lfg"
4eWmr6w0JjM,541.839,"and i saw a rep paladin that was like"
4eWmr6w0JjM,543.519,"1200 and i was like i'm gonna help this"
4eWmr6w0JjM,545.04,"guy get his 1400 so somebody said in"
4eWmr6w0JjM,547.2,"chat they said uh you think that"
4eWmr6w0JjM,548.8,"company's trying to maximize play time"
4eWmr6w0JjM,550.24,"they're trying to maximize revenue"
4eWmr6w0JjM,551.839,"you're not smart you're not smart for"
4eWmr6w0JjM,553.76,"trying to make this uh this surface"
4eWmr6w0JjM,556.48,"level"
4eWmr6w0JjM,557.68,"uh analysis"
4eWmr6w0JjM,559.36,"it's just such a surface level silly"
4eWmr6w0JjM,562.24,"analysis"
4eWmr6w0JjM,563.6,"because"
4eWmr6w0JjM,564.56,"you maximize revenue by getting people"
4eWmr6w0JjM,567.279,"to play the game"
4eWmr6w0JjM,568.959,"if somebody is not playing the game"
4eWmr6w0JjM,572.16,"they are not in the customer pool for"
4eWmr6w0JjM,574.72,"people that will buy a store mount they"
4eWmr6w0JjM,577.36,"are not in the customer pool for people"
4eWmr6w0JjM,579.6,"that are paying a subscription"
4eWmr6w0JjM,582.16,"you need to have people invested in the"
4eWmr6w0JjM,584.72,"game and playing the game in order for"
4eWmr6w0JjM,587.519,"them to potentially give you money"
4eWmr6w0JjM,589.519,"papaya mba yeah it's just it"
4eWmr6w0JjM,592.56,"these comments it's people think that"
4eWmr6w0JjM,594.959,"they're smart for saying stuff like this"
4eWmr6w0JjM,596.959,"is just so annoying to me you know"
4eWmr6w0JjM,598.959,"surface level analysis you're saying an"
4eWmr6w0JjM,600.399,"obvious thing which might not be true no"
4eWmr6w0JjM,602.56,"it is it is true it is"
4eWmr6w0JjM,605.92,"it is just"
4eWmr6w0JjM,607.36,"obviously true that if there are more"
4eWmr6w0JjM,610.079,"people playing the game there is a large"
4eWmr6w0JjM,613.04,"do you want to go fish"
4eWmr6w0JjM,614.72,"in a lake with 10 fish or a thousand"
4eWmr6w0JjM,617.44,"wait i mean it you've you don't need to"
4eWmr6w0JjM,619.839,"have"
4eWmr6w0JjM,620.8,"a [ __ ] mba to understand this it's"
4eWmr6w0JjM,623.76,"common [ __ ] sense"
4eWmr6w0JjM,625.6,"so he can upgrade his gear so i joined"
4eWmr6w0JjM,627.519,"his group we play a bunch of games he"
4eWmr6w0JjM,629.519,"goes up some rating he gets like 1500 or"
4eWmr6w0JjM,631.6,"something like that and then i noticed"
4eWmr6w0JjM,633.839,"he doesn't have a legendary i was like"
4eWmr6w0JjM,635.279,"whoa whoa whoa you don't have a"
4eWmr6w0JjM,636.64,"legendary that's crazy and then i"
4eWmr6w0JjM,638.48,"realized he didn't have a covenant okay"
4eWmr6w0JjM,640.959,"so he had no legendary someone says it"
4eWmr6w0JjM,643.44,"depends on the fish in the"
4eWmr6w0JjM,645.6,"guys y'all so like i understand that you"
4eWmr6w0JjM,648.48,"might make comments like this and people"
4eWmr6w0JjM,650.8,"thought it was smart"
4eWmr6w0JjM,652.399,"in like middle school or like high"
4eWmr6w0JjM,654.64,"school or something like that but"
4eWmr6w0JjM,657.279,"that's not smart to say that everybody"
4eWmr6w0JjM,659.6,"knows what we're talking about there's"
4eWmr6w0JjM,661.279,"no there's no implication that they're"
4eWmr6w0JjM,663.76,"different fish like it's just you just"
4eWmr6w0JjM,665.76,"come up with this thing to try to sound"
4eWmr6w0JjM,667.839,"smart like oh i'm smart because i have"
4eWmr6w0JjM,670.8,"you know i'm drawing this distinction"
4eWmr6w0JjM,672.56,"that's not part of the conversation"
4eWmr6w0JjM,675.44,"arguing semantics like it's just it's so"
4eWmr6w0JjM,677.92,"boring"
4eWmr6w0JjM,679.2,"it's so boring and tedious"
4eWmr6w0JjM,682.32,"and just completely aside from the point"
4eWmr6w0JjM,686.0,"no covenant and then he started linking"
4eWmr6w0JjM,688.16,"me his conduits"
4eWmr6w0JjM,690.079,"okay my concept is linking me as"
4eWmr6w0JjM,692.0,"conduits and asked how he could put them"

4eWmr6w0JjM,736.32,"he's got no chance so he's hard stuck"

4eWmr6w0JjM,740.959,"like 300 games played and then i joined"

4eWmr6w0JjM,770.079,"do to level them up and he says okay"
4eWmr6w0JjM,773.2,"reluctantly and then he literally quits"
4eWmr6w0JjM,776.88,"instead of doing all of those things he"
4eWmr6w0JjM,778.88,"literally just stops playing the game"
4eWmr6w0JjM,781.279,"he literally quit that day"
4eWmr6w0JjM,784.639,"like this is a true story this is"
4eWmr6w0JjM,786.399,"someone who wanted"
4eWmr6w0JjM,788.56,"someone who wanted to play nope he"

4eWmr6w0JjM,804.24,"grind your conduits he's [ __ ] out yeah"
4eWmr6w0JjM,806.32,"and he quit [ __ ] that exactly so"
4eWmr6w0JjM,808.959,"this is a true story of a real player"
4eWmr6w0JjM,811.92,"and i'm sure he's not the first person"
4eWmr6w0JjM,813.68,"okay"
4eWmr6w0JjM,814.56,"so i'm just putting that out there"
4eWmr6w0JjM,816.24,"people want to play the game"
4eWmr6w0JjM,818.32,"but it's way too jarring okay so i don't"
4eWmr6w0JjM,821.36,"know what needs to happen but"
4eWmr6w0JjM,823.519,"there's a problem there's a clear"
4eWmr6w0JjM,825.04,"problem"
4eWmr6w0JjM,826.0,"and uh it definitely needs to be fixed"
4eWmr6w0JjM,828.24,"because wow is not accessible right now"
4eWmr6w0JjM,830.16,"to someone returning to the game"
4eWmr6w0JjM,832.0,"period"
4eWmr6w0JjM,834.56,"yeah not accessible is a really good way"
4eWmr6w0JjM,836.8,"to say"
4eWmr6w0JjM,838.0,"it's sad he's starting the guy he just"
4eWmr6w0JjM,841.279,"he sees he's like yes you've gotta do"
4eWmr6w0JjM,843.12,"your conduits and um"
4eWmr6w0JjM,845.199,"uh it's like you've gotta plan this out"
4eWmr6w0JjM,847.76,"it's like how many people saw the"
4eWmr6w0JjM,850.32,"content in 9.2 about getting flying and"
4eWmr6w0JjM,853.44,"xerath mortis"
4eWmr6w0JjM,855.04,"and they said the same [ __ ] thing"
4eWmr6w0JjM,857.279,"they said oh"
4eWmr6w0JjM,858.72,"bro"
4eWmr6w0JjM,859.68,"what"
4eWmr6w0JjM,860.48,"dude"

4eWmr6w0JjM,868.839,"again you know what i mean like it's"
4eWmr6w0JjM,871.44,"just"
4eWmr6w0JjM,872.399,"it's too many [ __ ] things man it's"
4eWmr6w0JjM,875.199,"too many little [ __ ] things you've"
4eWmr6w0JjM,876.88,"got to do"
4eWmr6w0JjM,878.0,"and it's just you're not doing anybody"
4eWmr6w0JjM,880.639,"any favors by adding this [ __ ] into the"
4eWmr6w0JjM,882.88,"game you're not helping anybody out it's"
4eWmr6w0JjM,885.44,"just that the problem is that new"
4eWmr6w0JjM,888.16,"systems get added and old systems don't"
4eWmr6w0JjM,891.279,"get removed pue's struggling with this"
4eWmr6w0JjM,893.04,"as well"
4eWmr6w0JjM,894.0,"yeah no poe has the same problem in a"
4eWmr6w0JjM,896.48,"lot of ways and that's why they decide"
4eWmr6w0JjM,898.079,"they're like oh this is going to go core"
4eWmr6w0JjM,900.16,"this isn't synthesis didn't go core"
4eWmr6w0JjM,902.56,"metamorphosis did and guess what"
4eWmr6w0JjM,905.199,"metamorphosis is a whole [ __ ] lot"
4eWmr6w0JjM,907.76,"simpler than synthesis was metamorphosis"
4eWmr6w0JjM,911.12,"or so you kill all the guys and then you"
4eWmr6w0JjM,914.32,"make the all the guys that are a big guy"
4eWmr6w0JjM,916.639,"you kill the big guy"
4eWmr6w0JjM,918.399,"boom there it is"
4eWmr6w0JjM,920.32,"it's pretty [ __ ] simple"
4eWmr6w0JjM,922.56,"and"
4eWmr6w0JjM,923.44,"the problem is that you don't have"
4eWmr6w0JjM,926.399,"you don't remove things enough and"
4eWmr6w0JjM,929.519,"you don't take things out of the"
4eWmr6w0JjM,931.44,"rotation"
4eWmr6w0JjM,932.56,"enough and you just add in more and more"
4eWmr6w0JjM,934.88,"systems and that's really what the"
4eWmr6w0JjM,936.959,"problem is ggg actually recognize their"
4eWmr6w0JjM,939.519,"position no like"
4eWmr6w0JjM,941.519,"chris wilson grinding gear games they"
4eWmr6w0JjM,944.24,"[ __ ] know this is a problem that's"
4eWmr6w0JjM,945.839,"why they're making poe too that's why"
4eWmr6w0JjM,947.6,"they have so many different changes in"
4eWmr6w0JjM,948.88,"poe too it's because they know it's an"
4eWmr6w0JjM,950.8,"issue they're fully aware of it"
4eWmr6w0JjM,953.04,"wow it seems like they don't know it i"
4eWmr6w0JjM,955.199,"wish they did how can we get the devs"
4eWmr6w0JjM,956.72,"understand this talk about it that's the"
4eWmr6w0JjM,958.88,"best thing that we can do"
4eWmr6w0JjM,960.48,"i'm the type of player that likes to"
4eWmr6w0JjM,961.68,"play multiple characters depending on"
4eWmr6w0JjM,962.959,"what i feel for the week whether this"
4eWmr6w0JjM,964.399,"video described exactly what i've given"
4eWmr6w0JjM,965.92,"up on mythic plus and pvp yeah it's like"
4eWmr6w0JjM,968.399,"i'd i will never farm a secondary system"
4eWmr6w0JjM,971.68,"twice"
4eWmr6w0JjM,972.639,"it's that simple"
4eWmr6w0JjM,974.16,"i will never level up my renown two"
4eWmr6w0JjM,976.88,"times i will never level up my"
4eWmr6w0JjM,979.44,"reputation two times because there's no"
4eWmr6w0JjM,982.48,"reason for it i already did it it's it's"
4eWmr6w0JjM,985.92,"that simple"
4eWmr6w0JjM,987.199,"i i'm just not gonna do it i'm not gonna"
4eWmr6w0JjM,989.44,"waste my time on it it's not fun to do"
4eWmr6w0JjM,992.56,"and even if it is fun to do i already"
4eWmr6w0JjM,994.8,"did it and so why would i want to do it"
4eWmr6w0JjM,996.639,"again it's crazy you remember back"
4eWmr6w0JjM,998.88,"whenever ian said that people wanted to"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1001.279,"farm out renowned and they enjoyed"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1004.0,"farming like uh uh these like [ __ ]"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1006.88,"systems like how can you be so stupid to"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1009.839,"think that like it's just it's obviously"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1012.24,"not true like it's just it's so [ __ ]"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1014.48,"obviously not true and like i don't want"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1016.16,"to hear oh they've got the data they"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1017.839,"know what the data is if they knew what"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1019.519,"the [ __ ] data was and they were able"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1021.199,"to act on it in an intelligent way they"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1023.759,"wouldn't have been hemorrhaging"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1024.88,"subscribers for 10 years and then have"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1027.919,"to stop showing how many subs they have"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1030.4,"because it was so [ __ ] embarrassing"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1032.48,"obviously they don't know what they're"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1033.679,"doing because if they did it wouldn't"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1035.839,"happen it's crazy man absolutely [ __ ]"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1039.12,"crazy i hope they can fix this i really"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1041.6,"do i think that what they should do for"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1043.36,"9.2"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1044.799,"is they should make the pvp item level"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1046.959,"for any of the gear they should make it"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1049.52,"if you get combatants or you get"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1052.559,"even unranked"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1054.16,"you buy the gear and it maxes out your"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1057.039,"pvp lie level and it doesn't max out the"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1059.919,"pve eye level that's just it it makes"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1062.88,"sense it seems like it's a in my mind"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1065.52,"this seems like a perfect solution yeah"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1067.84,"i i don't know is is there any reason"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1069.84,"why not to do that yeah isn't this"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1071.6,"legion's going to people hated it no"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1073.039,"because you buy the pieces of gear that"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1074.799,"you earn and as you buy the pieces of"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1076.96,"gear your character gets more powerful"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1078.4,"that you have autonomy over it and you"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1080.16,"can also choose what pieces of gear you"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1081.679,"buy so you can get like one with haste"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1083.12,"or mastery or whatever for rated pvp"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1085.76,"only well for all pvp yeah uh if you're"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1088.48,"bad you should be punished yeah sure if"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1090.559,"that's the way you think fine but that's"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1092.64,"that if if that's the case it's not"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1094.88,"about being bad a lot of people aren't"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1096.559,"bad they just don't want to farm out a"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1099.6,"[ __ ] system on an alt like i would"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1102.24,"love to play"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1103.919,"i would love to play some of my alts"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1105.52,"here and i just don't have the option to"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1108.0,"do that you see what i'm saying like i"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1109.6,"don't have the option to do any of these"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1111.2,"other characters like why would i go"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1113.28,"over and play this character if i have"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1115.76,"to farm it out and do a bunch of other"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1117.6,"stuff it's insane man [ __ ] that if"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1120.0,"you're bad and punished for weak vp"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1121.919,"character then you'll never play pvp"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1123.44,"yeah exactly like there should be a"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1125.2,"point where like yeah"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1126.88,"in random bgs like you you and you're"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1129.12,"always gonna stomp on nubs you are"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1131.44,"always gonna stomp on nubs it doesn't"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1133.919,"matter"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1134.88,"even if they have the same gear as you"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1137.12,"and also they're not going to because"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1138.799,"they're going to be farming out the gear"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1140.16,"in the process and so you're still going"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1141.6,"to win in random beaches it doesn't even"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1143.039,"matter i don't want a woman's skill i"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1144.72,"want one with the gear that i grinded"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1146.0,"well no it's like i have no problem with"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1148.0,"people that get really good gear and"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1149.84,"they win bgs because they have really"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1151.28,"good gear that's fine but there needs to"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1153.679,"be a ceiling on that and the ceiling on"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1156.32,"that is too high right now like and also"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1159.52,"for rated pvp"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1161.36,"especially at a high level everybody has"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1163.2,"the same gear like that's generally what"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1165.28,"happens"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1166.32,"and so i i just i i think that's what"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1168.64,"they should do they should make it to"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1170.48,"where the pvp eye level starts to cap"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1173.28,"and the item upgrades increase the pve"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1175.919,"item level and that way people can get"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1177.919,"into pvp a lot faster without having to"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1180.559,"farm out a hundred thousand dollar"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1182.799,"that's just not a uh"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1185.12,"not a fun experience and also speaking"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1187.12,"of farming at 100 000 honor let's start"
4eWmr6w0JjM,1189.36,"doing it ourselves"

5S39-NZsmWk,18.48,"gonna work if you're smaller or if"
5S39-NZsmWk,20.31,"you're not either one also even though"
5S39-NZsmWk,22.26,"I'm wearing a key it's gonna work both G"
5S39-NZsmWk,23.97,"and no because there are no groups"
5S39-NZsmWk,25.619,"involved cool let's take a look so when"
5S39-NZsmWk,28.8,"I'm in bottom mount weather I got here"
5S39-NZsmWk,30.96,"from a scramble weather I got here from"
5S39-NZsmWk,32.969,"a slit guard pass by Vince doesn't"
5S39-NZsmWk,35.01,"really matter once I'm in this position"
5S39-NZsmWk,36.75,"they need to stay safe okay so I want to"
5S39-NZsmWk,39.0,"keep my elbows tight if I have my arms"
5S39-NZsmWk,41.01,"up that immediately tells him go high"
5S39-NZsmWk,43.62,"and get the armbar okay but if I also"
5S39-NZsmWk,46.59,"don't protect if I'm just here that"
5S39-NZsmWk,48.39,"exposes my neck and if we're just"
5S39-NZsmWk,50.28,"staying with the guy he can go for D"
5S39-NZsmWk,52.05,"chokes"
5S39-NZsmWk,52.469,"okay so positioning wise I want to stay"
5S39-NZsmWk,55.23,"make sure he's low okay now I can create"
5S39-NZsmWk,57.21,"a frame by creating uh you know the"
5S39-NZsmWk,60.149,"guard with my forearm here and then"
5S39-NZsmWk,61.98,"continuing on with my hand on my wrist"
5S39-NZsmWk,64.979,"and my elbow inside okay and not can"
5S39-NZsmWk,67.409,"sort of keep him at bay while I move"
5S39-NZsmWk,70.5,"back okay also if I just have my elbows"
5S39-NZsmWk,73.53,"in that can be good too to try to keep"
5S39-NZsmWk,75.479,"him at bay okay"
5S39-NZsmWk,77.369,"and also my legs are active okay I never"
5S39-NZsmWk,79.979,"have my legs just here"
5S39-NZsmWk,81.24,"I need the leverage of my hips of my"
5S39-NZsmWk,83.729,"legs everything engaged everything tight"
5S39-NZsmWk,86.04,"now Vince what he wants to do is"
5S39-NZsmWk,88.29,"something completely different"
5S39-NZsmWk,89.61,"yeah so basically I want to do what the"
5S39-NZsmWk,91.35,"opposite of what Aaron's trying to"
5S39-NZsmWk,93.06,"protect so I do want to get underneath"
5S39-NZsmWk,95.13,"these armpits here so I can pinch my"
5S39-NZsmWk,96.93,"knees together it can start working my s"
5S39-NZsmWk,99.119,"Mountain going forearm bars or we talked"
5S39-NZsmWk,101.97,"about this before and in the three ways"
5S39-NZsmWk,103.47,"to keep mount video I like to go and get"
5S39-NZsmWk,105.99,"a low mount here where I'm hooking"
5S39-NZsmWk,108.149,"underneath her legs and I'm shoving my"
5S39-NZsmWk,111.299,"weight down and pushing my hips board"
5S39-NZsmWk,113.009,"and I'm able to balance here on Aaron"
5S39-NZsmWk,114.75,"and keep this mount I don't really want"
5S39-NZsmWk,116.939,"to be stuck in this position where my"
5S39-NZsmWk,118.89,"hips are right above hers and she can"
5S39-NZsmWk,120.39,"start bucking and moving around and I'm"
5S39-NZsmWk,122.25,"gonna be off balance right so I don't"
5S39-NZsmWk,124.68,"mind actually a lot of people are gonna"
5S39-NZsmWk,126.329,"keep their base low so he's actually"
5S39-NZsmWk,128.22,"gonna be down here when he works for any"
5S39-NZsmWk,130.44,"submissions or further positions so if I"
5S39-NZsmWk,133.66,"I know I don't need to have him up right"
5S39-NZsmWk,135.58,"I can have him down up but if I want I"
5S39-NZsmWk,138.04,"can bump right and then we're in closer"
5S39-NZsmWk,139.63,"range okay because obviously if he's"
5S39-NZsmWk,141.82,"sitting up it's easier for him to scoot"
5S39-NZsmWk,144.04,"his hips forward right but if he's low"
5S39-NZsmWk,146.41,"and then tries to get high mount the"
5S39-NZsmWk,147.94,"same time it's a little bit difficult"
5S39-NZsmWk,149.11,"right so at least I can sort of play"
5S39-NZsmWk,151.09,"with it and get a position that I'm"
5S39-NZsmWk,152.77,"comfortable in so from here the first"
5S39-NZsmWk,155.17,"one that we're gonna go into is getting"
5S39-NZsmWk,157.15,"to half guard okay so I have my elbows"
5S39-NZsmWk,159.13,"tight now I'm gonna hip escape okay so"
5S39-NZsmWk,161.62,"my right leg is gonna stay planted"
5S39-NZsmWk,163.24,"because I'm turning this way boom I have"
5S39-NZsmWk,166.6,"my elbows tight okay see how I have more"
5S39-NZsmWk,169.54,"space I just created some space cuz I'm"
5S39-NZsmWk,171.91,"on my hip now I'm gonna push his knee"
5S39-NZsmWk,174.43,"and I'm gonna get my knee inside all I"
5S39-NZsmWk,176.32,"need is to get my shin on his thigh now"
5S39-NZsmWk,179.26,"I'm gonna change it I'm gonna hip escape"
5S39-NZsmWk,181.18,"that way okay watch like this now I can"
5S39-NZsmWk,186.52,"either use a sweep from here and keeping"
5S39-NZsmWk,188.5,"the distance with my hands or I can go"
5S39-NZsmWk,190.51,"to half guard and get the underhook okay"
5S39-NZsmWk,193.48,"whichever you prefer but either one is"
5S39-NZsmWk,195.82,"gonna be away from me not only to escape"
5S39-NZsmWk,198.25,"but to advance my position afterwards"
5S39-NZsmWk,200.17,"okay cuz I don't want to escape Matt"
5S39-NZsmWk,202.18,"just have him get him out again so beer"
5S39-NZsmWk,206.19,"I'm gonna hit this Cape okay I'm gonna"
5S39-NZsmWk,209.56,"push the leg I'm gonna get my leg three"
5S39-NZsmWk,212.08,"and I'm gonna turn in him I don't want"
5S39-NZsmWk,214.27,"to stay flat this is not good for me so"
5S39-NZsmWk,216.01,"from here I'm gonna turn all the way the"
5S39-NZsmWk,218.35,"other side frame okay now I can take my"
5S39-NZsmWk,221.11,"foot in half guard come up on my elbow"
5S39-NZsmWk,224.08,"get the deep under hook and he's still"
5S39-NZsmWk,225.94,"in trouble"
5S39-NZsmWk,226.53,"so the second position is a little bit"
5S39-NZsmWk,229.03,"better than the first now we're gonna"
5S39-NZsmWk,230.38,"recover a full guard so again I don't"
5S39-NZsmWk,231.97,"want him to be in high mount now I'm"
5S39-NZsmWk,234.07,"gonna keep my elbows inside of his legs"
5S39-NZsmWk,235.9,"which is gonna prevent him from going to"
5S39-NZsmWk,237.459,"high mount and now I'm gonna cut his"
5S39-NZsmWk,239.26,"hips okay now I'm gonna use a bridge and"
5S39-NZsmWk,241.81,"it's gonna be a fast and a big bridge"
5S39-NZsmWk,243.82,"okay I want to get my hips think about"
5S39-NZsmWk,245.56,"the hip thrusting exercises exactly when"
5S39-NZsmWk,247.6,"I what I want to do and I want to be"
5S39-NZsmWk,249.28,"explosive but I'm also gonna gauge my"
5S39-NZsmWk,251.17,"arms so like this so I'm gonna use my"
5S39-NZsmWk,254.739,"hips to thrust up and then I'm gonna"
5S39-NZsmWk,257.29,"lock my arms so that I have enough time"
5S39-NZsmWk,260.109,"to get my knees inside and again I'm"
5S39-NZsmWk,262.09,"have now I have what my shin on his"
5S39-NZsmWk,264.669,"thigh"
5S39-NZsmWk,265.1,"and I'm flexing my feet to make sure"
5S39-NZsmWk,267.08,"that he can't go backwards"
5S39-NZsmWk,268.19,"these are like the butterfly hooks right"
5S39-NZsmWk,269.84,"because I'm controlling now but also for"
5S39-NZsmWk,271.73,"butterfly guard I don't want to be"
5S39-NZsmWk,273.23,"sitting on my back"
5S39-NZsmWk,274.04,"so as soon as I get it now I'm gonna"
5S39-NZsmWk,275.42,"push my legs forward and I'm going to"
5S39-NZsmWk,277.64,"step up if I can get double underhooks"
5S39-NZsmWk,279.65,"that's great if not then at least we're"
5S39-NZsmWk,282.92,"in a good position to even go into a"
5S39-NZsmWk,284.72,"different guard if I wanted to again I"
5S39-NZsmWk,290.11,"have my elbows tight to my side cupping"
5S39-NZsmWk,293.12,"the hip I'm gonna lock my arms and bring"
5S39-NZsmWk,296.36,"see how I can hold him here boom well"
5S39-NZsmWk,298.7,"he's helping out but ideally I could"
5S39-NZsmWk,300.95,"still do so I have my legs they're not"
5S39-NZsmWk,303.23,"like this they're open my feet are"
5S39-NZsmWk,305.12,"flexed and he's sitting sitting on my"
5S39-NZsmWk,307.07,"shins"
5S39-NZsmWk,307.64,"now I'm gonna sit up standing the leg"
5S39-NZsmWk,310.24,"work from there so the third one is the"
5S39-NZsmWk,314.09,"most important one and I guess it's the"
5S39-NZsmWk,315.53,"most basic that they're gonna teach you"
5S39-NZsmWk,317.03,"when you first start training jiu-jitsu"
5S39-NZsmWk,318.2,"but for me a lot of people don't do it"
5S39-NZsmWk,321.29,"right because they don't do a bridge"
5S39-NZsmWk,322.76,"high enough ok so now I'm gonna try to"
5S39-NZsmWk,325.19,"get on top that's the best situation for"
5S39-NZsmWk,327.92,"me to go from bottom to top in one fluid"
5S39-NZsmWk,331.04,"motion ok so I want to trap one arm just"
5S39-NZsmWk,334.37,"because if I do bridge he can post ok"
5S39-NZsmWk,338.27,"but notice how I'm bridging I want to"
5S39-NZsmWk,340.55,"choose a side okay so I want to make"
5S39-NZsmWk,342.98,"sure that I'm gonna aim to reverse him"
5S39-NZsmWk,346.28,"his back seemed to go on the floor and"
5S39-NZsmWk,347.45,"then I'm gonna be in closed guard so now"
5S39-NZsmWk,349.1,"I need to trap an arm so it doesn't have"
5S39-NZsmWk,352.01,"to be a super technical thing you just"
5S39-NZsmWk,355.49,"need to grab it arm so he can't post and"
5S39-NZsmWk,357.41,"bridge I'm gonna bridge so high and I'm"
5S39-NZsmWk,359.27,"gonna step over so that he won't be able"
5S39-NZsmWk,361.61,"to defend it just like this like this so"
5S39-NZsmWk,368.6,"when I do it alone this is what its"
5S39-NZsmWk,370.79,"gonna look like ok so I'm not just"
5S39-NZsmWk,372.56,"coming up like the other one the other"
5S39-NZsmWk,374.33,"one was here ok I'm actually gonna come"
5S39-NZsmWk,377.3,"up and watch this I'm gonna take a step"
5S39-NZsmWk,379.42,"like this and then I'm gonna be in"
5S39-NZsmWk,382.04,"closed guard ok"
5S39-NZsmWk,382.97,"so it's not this it's not coming up on"
5S39-NZsmWk,385.58,"my shoulder ok"
5S39-NZsmWk,386.87,"it's not just this it's both ok boom"
5S39-NZsmWk,389.84,"taking a step"
5S39-NZsmWk,393.02,"so now with Vince trap the arm boom"
5S39-NZsmWk,401.9,"think about if he's riding a horse and"
5S39-NZsmWk,406.7,"the horse bucks he's gonna be throwing"
5S39-NZsmWk,408.02,"forward that's what I want but I don't"
5S39-NZsmWk,409.7,"want to just go forward because then you"
5S39-NZsmWk,411.56,"can post I want him to come here and"
5S39-NZsmWk,413.54,"then up turning and falling over because"
5S39-NZsmWk,416.09,"of my hips so I make sure that when"
5S39-NZsmWk,419.39,"you're on bottom you're always gonna"
5S39-NZsmWk,420.32,"protect yourself but then remember you"
5S39-NZsmWk,422.27,"have half guard you have a butterfly or"
5S39-NZsmWk,424.04,"full guard and then you have getting on"
5S39-NZsmWk,426.26,"top so either one you want to be able to"
5S39-NZsmWk,428.33,"use well and consecutively and then"
5S39-NZsmWk,431.81,"multiple attacks is gonna help you out a"
5S39-NZsmWk,433.22,"lot too so remember guys that if you get"
5S39-NZsmWk,435.59,"into bottom mount it's not the end of"
5S39-NZsmWk,437.42,"the world don't panic right we're gonna"
5S39-NZsmWk,439.28,"have our frame we're gonna be safe and"
5S39-NZsmWk,441.38,"we're gonna think of the three ways that"
5S39-NZsmWk,442.64,"we want to get out whether it's to go to"
5S39-NZsmWk,444.5,"half guard whether it's to get to full"
5S39-NZsmWk,446.39,"butterfly guard or if it's to bridge"
5S39-NZsmWk,448.97,"over and get into close guard and get"
5S39-NZsmWk,450.47,"back on top there are options you could"
5S39-NZsmWk,452.78,"use one you could use three two you can"
5S39-NZsmWk,454.61,"use them all in conjunction and again"
5S39-NZsmWk,456.35,"for a bigger opponent it's going to work"
5S39-NZsmWk,458.48,"also jeah noogie I mean doesn't matter"

6Izjz2aEzgs,33.84,"little bit bigger wheel"
6Izjz2aEzgs,35.44,"but i think that's going to be okay"

6Izjz2aEzgs,63.039,"zero zero"
6Izjz2aEzgs,66.799,"i'm with trevor on this there's a zero"
6Izjz2aEzgs,68.56,"percent chance that's gonna work"
6Izjz2aEzgs,70.84,"but that's not gonna stop me from"

6Izjz2aEzgs,158.959,"miles from being able to get to it"
6Izjz2aEzgs,161.12,"with anything when it failed when the"
6Izjz2aEzgs,163.28,"morveira was able to get to it just fine"
6Izjz2aEzgs,165.92,"i don't know if the more the more it"
6Izjz2aEzgs,167.84,"would have been tricky to do the job"
6Izjz2aEzgs,169.36,"with them"
6Izjz2aEzgs,170.239,"okay"
6Izjz2aEzgs,171.12,"so this is fifteen and five sixteen"

6uSiazIcEN4,106.24,"people are going to freak out about this"
6uSiazIcEN4,107.92,"because i mean that's just how the"

6uSiazIcEN4,111.439,"business and shareholders and companies"
6uSiazIcEN4,113.759,"with shareholders work they're just you"
6uSiazIcEN4,115.439,"know saying random stuff to just get"
6uSiazIcEN4,117.439,"their likes and their retweets to look"
6uSiazIcEN4,119.28,"like they're helping but they're not"
6uSiazIcEN4,120.56,"really doing a damn thing but bobby"
6uSiazIcEN4,122.64,"kotak is a part of this deal now more"
6uSiazIcEN4,124.64,"than likely once the ink dries on"
6uSiazIcEN4,126.64,"everything they're gonna give him a"
6uSiazIcEN4,127.84,"contract they'll probably buy him out"
6uSiazIcEN4,130.08,"and then he will be setting off on his"
6uSiazIcEN4,131.92,"merry way but i do find it ironic that a"
6uSiazIcEN4,134.48,"lot of people who are you know talking"
6uSiazIcEN4,136.4,"so negatively about activision and"
6uSiazIcEN4,138.319,"blizzard i'm never supporting their"
6uSiazIcEN4,139.76,"products i'm never talking about their"
6uSiazIcEN4,141.36,"products ever again are now once again"
6uSiazIcEN4,143.76,"talking about it which is why i took a"
6uSiazIcEN4,145.44,"completely different stance on that"
6uSiazIcEN4,147.28,"because i don't really care about"
6uSiazIcEN4,148.959,"twitter likes and retweets and stuff"
6uSiazIcEN4,151.28,"like that i'm not here to champion that"
6uSiazIcEN4,153.28,"i'm a good person because i don't like"
6uSiazIcEN4,155.76,"activision like they're scumbags at"
6uSiazIcEN4,157.68,"every video game company it's something"
6uSiazIcEN4,159.519,"that's rampant without the industry but"
6uSiazIcEN4,161.68,"yes this merger costs 68.7 billion"
6uSiazIcEN4,164.959,"dollars making it just an absolutely"
6uSiazIcEN4,167.76,"insane acquisition now what does this"
6uSiazIcEN4,170.239,"mean what companies are actually"
6uSiazIcEN4,171.84,"involved with this merger well it's"
6uSiazIcEN4,174.16,"everyone under the activision and"
6uSiazIcEN4,175.68,"blizzard bundle so you have activision"
6uSiazIcEN4,177.68,"blizzard bnox demon ware digital legends"
6uSiazIcEN4,180.56,"high moon studios infinity ward king"
6uSiazIcEN4,182.879,"major league gaming radical"
6uSiazIcEN4,184.319,"entertainment raven soft sledgehammers"
6uSiazIcEN4,186.72,"games toys for bobs treyarch and more"
6uSiazIcEN4,189.76,"teams involved so aside from your heavy"
6uSiazIcEN4,192.239,"hitters like your call of duties and"
6uSiazIcEN4,193.76,"your diablos and stuff probably some of"
6uSiazIcEN4,195.84,"the first games that spring to mind with"
6uSiazIcEN4,197.28,"this you gotta remember microsoft now"
6uSiazIcEN4,199.28,"owns spyro the dragon microsoft now owns"
6uSiazIcEN4,202.8,"the tony hawk lineup of games which is"
6uSiazIcEN4,204.879,"definitely seeing a resurgence microsoft"
6uSiazIcEN4,207.28,"owns what was arguably"
6uSiazIcEN4,209.76,"sony's first mascot with crash bandicoot"
6uSiazIcEN4,214.56,"and that man"
6uSiazIcEN4,216.08,"that that's kind of a very interesting"
6uSiazIcEN4,218.56,"thing to me because you know back in the"
6uSiazIcEN4,220.799,"day it was like sonic the hedgehog for"
6uSiazIcEN4,223.28,"sega it was mario for nintendo and it"
6uSiazIcEN4,226.0,"was crash bandicoot for sony look at"
6uSiazIcEN4,228.159,"those old ads"
6uSiazIcEN4,229.68,"come here plumber boy like sony was"
6uSiazIcEN4,232.239,"taking shots at nintendo with crash"
6uSiazIcEN4,234.319,"bandicoot now of course as time has gone"
6uSiazIcEN4,236.239,"on they've sort of reshifted their focus"
6uSiazIcEN4,238.319,"i guess kratos is like now their mascot"
6uSiazIcEN4,240.56,"or something like that but this is a"
6uSiazIcEN4,242.959,"very a very iconic thing now what does"
6uSiazIcEN4,245.92,"this mean going forward well i think it"
6uSiazIcEN4,247.84,"means a lot of things because obviously"
6uSiazIcEN4,249.84,"every activision and blizzard game is"
6uSiazIcEN4,251.76,"now going to be coming to game pass on"
6uSiazIcEN4,253.68,"day one much like we saw when bethesda"
6uSiazIcEN4,256.16,"was gotten and purchased by microsoft"
6uSiazIcEN4,258.16,"the back catalog of games is obviously"
6uSiazIcEN4,260.72,"going to be available on game pass as"
6uSiazIcEN4,263.28,"well because i mean it wasn't just like"
6uSiazIcEN4,265.44,"bethesda put new games on game pass they"
6uSiazIcEN4,267.84,"put their back catalog of stuff on there"
6uSiazIcEN4,270.08,"and you can play pretty much everything"
6uSiazIcEN4,272.0,"that they've released in the past decade"
6uSiazIcEN4,273.919,"plus on game pass so that's really going"
6uSiazIcEN4,276.32,"to bolster game passes library with"
6uSiazIcEN4,278.0,"things like the crash bandicoot games"
6uSiazIcEN4,279.84,"the spyro games the tony hawk games even"
6uSiazIcEN4,282.88,"of course the call of duty games that's"
6uSiazIcEN4,285.28,"going to be very interesting because"
6uSiazIcEN4,286.72,"when you look at the npd sales the"
6uSiazIcEN4,288.88,"best-selling game on playstation"
6uSiazIcEN4,290.56,"consoles last year"
6uSiazIcEN4,292.4,"was call of duty like for all the"
6uSiazIcEN4,294.639,"outrage for all the nonsense we hate"
6uSiazIcEN4,297.44,"activision people still went out and"
6uSiazIcEN4,299.36,"bought call of duty at record-breaking"
6uSiazIcEN4,302.479,"numbers now yes the game might not have"
6uSiazIcEN4,304.16,"been all that good but that just goes to"
6uSiazIcEN4,305.84,"show you sort of the disconnect between"
6uSiazIcEN4,307.52,"the twitter world and the real world"
6uSiazIcEN4,309.52,"because in the real world people are"
6uSiazIcEN4,310.72,"just gonna do sort of whatever they want"
6uSiazIcEN4,312.56,"to do and they don't need to do things"
6uSiazIcEN4,315.12,"for the admiration of fellow twitter"
6uSiazIcEN4,317.6,"users and things of that nature now how"
6uSiazIcEN4,320.16,"does this impact nintendo and of course"
6uSiazIcEN4,322.639,"sony because i mean when you're buying"
6uSiazIcEN4,324.56,"one of the largest companies in the"
6uSiazIcEN4,325.84,"world obviously a company that sells"
6uSiazIcEN4,327.84,"usually best on playstation how is this"
6uSiazIcEN4,330.24,"going to impact the business"
6uSiazIcEN4,331.52,"relationships because there's activision"
6uSiazIcEN4,333.36,"games on of course playstation platforms"
6uSiazIcEN4,336.08,"and of course you see activision games"
6uSiazIcEN4,338.639,"on nintendo platforms and blizzard games"
6uSiazIcEN4,340.479,"on nintendo platforms with things like"
6uSiazIcEN4,341.919,"crash bandicoot tony hawk diablo well"
6uSiazIcEN4,345.039,"microsoft did say that"
6uSiazIcEN4,347.52,"activision blizzard is going to work as"
6uSiazIcEN4,349.84,"a separate entity so much like they're"
6uSiazIcEN4,352.24,"doing with bethesda they're gonna be"
6uSiazIcEN4,353.84,"allowed to do their own thing but that"
6uSiazIcEN4,356.08,"really is"
6uSiazIcEN4,357.28,"makes things very interesting for the"
6uSiazIcEN4,358.639,"future because could you imagine like"
6uSiazIcEN4,360.639,"the new call of duty game coming out on"
6uSiazIcEN4,363.12,"the xbox before it comes out on the"
6uSiazIcEN4,365.44,"playstation like how is the business end"
6uSiazIcEN4,367.6,"of this going to work as far as"
6uSiazIcEN4,368.96,"releasing games are concerned because"
6uSiazIcEN4,371.039,"right now microsoft owns what sold best"
6uSiazIcEN4,374.16,"on playstation systems in 2021 according"
6uSiazIcEN4,377.12,"to the mpd charts and so at least in the"
6uSiazIcEN4,379.44,"united states so"
6uSiazIcEN4,381.199,"that's that's a huge thing that's"
6uSiazIcEN4,383.12,"absolutely"
6uSiazIcEN4,384.4,"massive that microsoft made this"
6uSiazIcEN4,386.96,"acquisition obviously there's going to"
6uSiazIcEN4,388.479,"be changes within the company obviously"
6uSiazIcEN4,390.4,"bobby coddick is going to be gone"
6uSiazIcEN4,392.24,"probably sooner rather than later i'm"
6uSiazIcEN4,394.16,"sure they are trying to get him out as"
6uSiazIcEN4,396.8,"humanly as soon as humanly possible but"
6uSiazIcEN4,399.44,"it's just it's absolutely insane and it"
6uSiazIcEN4,401.919,"really shows you"
6uSiazIcEN4,403.199,"you know how microsoft is really"
6uSiazIcEN4,405.039,"approaching this generation they're not"
6uSiazIcEN4,407.28,"pulling any punches here they're not"
6uSiazIcEN4,409.68,"they're not they're doing what they want"
6uSiazIcEN4,411.36,"to do they're doing what they set out to"
6uSiazIcEN4,412.88,"do is to get people to play their games"
6uSiazIcEN4,415.52,"no matter what platform they own and"
6uSiazIcEN4,417.68,"they're really driving this point home"
6uSiazIcEN4,419.84,"so much in fact to the point of where i"
6uSiazIcEN4,421.599,"think these other companies companies"
6uSiazIcEN4,423.12,"like um sony and companies like nintendo"
6uSiazIcEN4,426.0,"have to take notice to this because"
6uSiazIcEN4,427.52,"microsoft allegedly wants game pass"
6uSiazIcEN4,430.08,"available on those platforms now if they"
6uSiazIcEN4,432.56,"were to get game pass on those platforms"
6uSiazIcEN4,434.56,"i think the whole video game landscape"
6uSiazIcEN4,436.639,"would change i think a lot of companies"
6uSiazIcEN4,438.479,"would probably go out of business i'm"
6uSiazIcEN4,440.4,"gonna go ahead and say that because"
6uSiazIcEN4,442.0,"while we hear that game pass is very"
6uSiazIcEN4,443.599,"sustainable we've never actually seen"
6uSiazIcEN4,445.44,"any concrete numbers for it obviously a"
6uSiazIcEN4,447.599,"lot of companies get paid to put their"
6uSiazIcEN4,449.44,"game on game pass but i really feel like"
6uSiazIcEN4,451.68,"it would it would change the absolute"
6uSiazIcEN4,454.0,"landscape of gaming and just become"
6uSiazIcEN4,455.919,"almost like a monopoly if you think"
6uSiazIcEN4,457.759,"about it as far as how you end up"
6uSiazIcEN4,460.0,"getting your games because obviously"
6uSiazIcEN4,461.44,"people are gonna want to go towards game"
6uSiazIcEN4,463.68,"pass but that's definitely something to"
6uSiazIcEN4,465.44,"just look at in the future that's sort"
6uSiazIcEN4,467.44,"of a worst case scenario i feel i'm not"
6uSiazIcEN4,469.52,"going to doom and gloom this and say oh"
6uSiazIcEN4,471.919,"that's exactly what's going to happen"
6uSiazIcEN4,473.599,"that's what microsoft wants to do they"
6uSiazIcEN4,475.599,"want to make it so there's only one"
6uSiazIcEN4,477.28,"place that you get your games and that's"
6uSiazIcEN4,479.36,"where you get your game so they always"
6uSiazIcEN4,480.96,"see money from it but i mean at the end"
6uSiazIcEN4,483.12,"of the day microsoft is a business"
6uSiazIcEN4,485.52,"microsoft is a business company"
6uSiazIcEN4,487.039,"microsoft is in the business of making"
6uSiazIcEN4,489.28,"money these companies ain't your friend"
6uSiazIcEN4,490.879,"homie these companies don't have your"
6uSiazIcEN4,492.96,"back i don't know how many times i have"
6uSiazIcEN4,494.56,"to say it but you know these companies"
6uSiazIcEN4,496.8,"they look out for number one they look"
6uSiazIcEN4,498.24,"out for their bottom line they look out"
6uSiazIcEN4,499.68,"for their shareholders they look out for"
6uSiazIcEN4,501.52,"making the most money and this is"
6uSiazIcEN4,503.28,"obviously a massive massive acquisition"
6uSiazIcEN4,507.12,"call of duty is now owned by xbox"
6uSiazIcEN4,511.36,"spyro the dragon crash bandicoot tony"
6uSiazIcEN4,514.8,"hawk diablo starcraft all owned by xbox"
6uSiazIcEN4,519.519,"and microsoft right now so"
6uSiazIcEN4,522.0,"man"
6uSiazIcEN4,523.68,"man overwatch overwatch isn't that still"
6uSiazIcEN4,526.56,"big hearthstone like holy man this"
6uSiazIcEN4,529.76,"is absolutely this is absolutely nuts"
6uSiazIcEN4,532.0,"and i honestly don't know what to say"
6uSiazIcEN4,535.12,"sort of beyond the main news story"
6uSiazIcEN4,537.04,"portion of it because a lot of it"
6uSiazIcEN4,538.24,"remains to be seen but just judging how"
6uSiazIcEN4,540.32,"we saw microsoft handle bethesda and how"
6uSiazIcEN4,542.959,"they handled it on their own console"
6uSiazIcEN4,544.64,"when it came to things like game pass"
6uSiazIcEN4,546.64,"and upcoming releases i mean starfield"
6uSiazIcEN4,549.12,"is a is a microsoft exclusive game"
6uSiazIcEN4,551.36,"that's not coming to playstation at"
6uSiazIcEN4,552.959,"least anytime soon probably you know if"
6uSiazIcEN4,555.519,"it ever does it would be a year down the"
6uSiazIcEN4,557.44,"road or something like that so are we"
6uSiazIcEN4,559.2,"going to see that with microsoft and"
6uSiazIcEN4,561.839,"activision games and blizzard games"
6uSiazIcEN4,563.6,"where they come first to the xbox and"
6uSiazIcEN4,565.92,"maybe never even come to other consoles"

7SHuq5y_7CY,126.32,"this is where his grip is the weakest so"
7SHuq5y_7CY,129.119,"you should tense your neck muscles"

7SHuq5y_7CY,203.92,"and since this is the most popular"

7SHuq5y_7CY,207.599,"to defend against it"

7SHuq5y_7CY,231.28,"choke the last technique is a bit more"

7SHuq5y_7CY,250.08,"next thing the feet one of them should"
7SHuq5y_7CY,252.799,"go"
7SHuq5y_7CY,253.12,"on his hip and the other should be near"
7SHuq5y_7CY,255.519,"his armpit"
7SHuq5y_7CY,256.88,"the foot that should be on his hip"
7SHuq5y_7CY,259.199,"should move the same place"

7SHuq5y_7CY,266.08,"hand"
7SHuq5y_7CY,266.8,"at this point you just thrust your hips"
7SHuq5y_7CY,269.52,"up"
7SHuq5y_7CY,270.0,"and you have him depending on how much"
7SHuq5y_7CY,272.56,"he hurt you"

8hy-OYsvhHQ,147.04,"distributing that as required to people"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,150.0,"we're also really keen to understand"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,152.8,"what the impact is on clean drinking"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,154.64,"water and on food gardens"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,157.2,"while the eruption was felt much further"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,159.2,"than tonga it triggered a tsunami"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,160.959,"warning across the pacific in new"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,162.48,"zealand and australia in the u.s even in"

8hy-OYsvhHQ,187.68,"home"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,188.56,"the most pressing concern would be"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,190.64,"the water as a lot of tongans"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,193.519,"collected rain water in their tanks and"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,196.0,"boiled them for drinking water but that"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,197.599,"has been contaminated by the ash a lot"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,199.92,"of housing needs to be fixed so that's"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,202.56,"what we're looking at right now moss and"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,204.48,"protection um because of the air"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,207.28,"it's a tragic event but it has really"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,209.2,"shown the unity between the tongans all"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,211.36,"over the world"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,212.4,"especially since we cannot contact our"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,215.04,"families directly we're really just"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,217.599,"holding on to each other and trying to"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,219.68,"keep in touch"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,221.92,"for any sign of what's happening there"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,226.4,"but yeah it's just"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,228.08,"doing what we can"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,229.519,"waiting hoping and slowly good news is"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,232.72,"trickling in"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,234.08,"while surveillance flights from"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,235.2,"australia and new zealand reported"

8hy-OYsvhHQ,250.64,"what"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,251.76,"the orion is doing is as a"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,253.519,"reconnaissance"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,255.2,"it is as are the australians looking to"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,258.16,"undertake an assessment uh from the air"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,261.6,"of the outer islands in particular"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,264.0,"and then of course provide that"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,265.52,"information uh to the people of tonga"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,267.84,"and tongan authorities"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,269.84,"ash cloud does pose a risk um the view"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,273.199,"on departure was that they would be able"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,274.96,"to undertake that that over flight"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,277.199,"reconnaissance though and provide that"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,279.36,"really critical information back well"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,282.0,"experts have called the eruption a one"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,283.759,"in a thousand year event these images"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,286.0,"give you a sense of the scale this image"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,288.16,"was taken on the 2nd of january 13 days"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,290.639,"before the eruption then this was taken"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,292.72,"shortly after the eruption on january"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,294.72,"the 15th the volcano is completely"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,297.36,"submerged this shows you the northern"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,299.36,"part of tonga's main island a day before"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,301.44,"the eruption a day after it villages"

8hy-OYsvhHQ,308.32,"university of oxford there are many"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,310.24,"underwater volcanoes but this on in"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,312.8,"terms of scale this is the probably the"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,314.72,"largest"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,315.84,"uh underwater volcano eruption that"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,317.68,"we've seen"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,318.88,"for the last few decades um there was a"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,321.28,"similar sort of eruption at krakatoa"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,322.96,"about three years ago"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,324.72,"but the presence of water"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,327.36,"uh"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,328.16,"a small amount of water and lots of hot"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,330.32,"rock means that you get much more"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,332.16,"violent explosions the water"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,334.32,"is rapidly converted to steam"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,337.36,"as it comes into contact with the magma"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,340.0,"it shatters the volcanic rocks it"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,342.16,"produces much more fine ash material"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,344.8,"but also"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,345.84,"the steam expansion drives the explosion"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,348.8,"itself so it's a really very violent"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,351.28,"eruption"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,352.639,"well there are other concerns too"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,354.16,"tonga's had just one covert 19 case"

8hy-OYsvhHQ,395.28,"communication is very limited at the"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,397.68,"moment only a handful of people have"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,399.44,"satellite phones which seems to be the"

8hy-OYsvhHQ,468.4,"well tonga is covert free much like many"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,471.68,"countries in the pacific"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,473.759,"so everyone who goes into tonga for this"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,476.96,"effort will be fully vaccinated and will"

8hy-OYsvhHQ,591.2,"boom was heard in neighbouring fiji and"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,593.519,"a tsunami caused these waves in the"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,595.68,"fijian capital suva we know some areas"

8hy-OYsvhHQ,619.76,"including videos of the of that volcanic"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,622.32,"eruption"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,623.44,"so immediately after that a little bit"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,625.839,"after six people in fiji were reporting"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,628.959,"hearing sort of a loud uh thud"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,632.8,"thunderous noise from the sky"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,636.399,"assuming we had not received"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,637.839,"confirmation but assuming it was"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,641.04,"coming from tonga from the earthquake"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,643.44,"area"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,644.959,"and how soon after you heard the sonic"

8hy-OYsvhHQ,650.64,"um immediately after say about uh i"

8hy-OYsvhHQ,671.44,"tamatapu the capital you can't see one"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,673.839,"of the islands on a lao so the islands"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,676.88,"around"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,677.76,"the lao group were reporting"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,679.839,"um"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,680.42,"[Music]"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,682.0,"like storm surges"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,684.079,"and also tsunami waves uh just hitting"

8hy-OYsvhHQ,688.8,"islands"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,690.8,"and tell me about the tongan community"

8hy-OYsvhHQ,697.68,"yes it is um we have a large uh tongan"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,701.44,"community here because"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,703.12,"of uh the fact that we have the regional"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,706.079,"university based here in suva the"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,707.76,"university of the south pacific so we"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,709.6,"have thousands and thousands of tongans"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,711.44,"who live here and also considering the"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,714.0,"historical relationship that we have"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,715.839,"with tonga a lot of fijians"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,718.32,"still have tongan relations and some"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,720.48,"still carry tonga names"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,722.639,"because of that historical factor to our"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,725.2,"relations but we do have thousands of"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,727.6,"tongans living here"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,729.44,"since saturday we have been able to"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,731.68,"speak to tomlins"

8hy-OYsvhHQ,735.519,"to this mom who studies at the"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,737.519,"university here but hasn't managed to"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,739.279,"speak to her husband and children"

8hy-OYsvhHQ,745.6,"to get someone from tonga"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,747.68,"media colleagues we can't reach because"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,749.6,"communications is down i know that has"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,751.68,"been widely reported and hopefully uh"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,754.639,"throughout the next few days"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,756.56,"new zealand has pledged to go in and"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,758.56,"conduct an aerial survey uh of"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,760.959,"assessments of what the situation has"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,762.639,"been and i i know that uh prime minister"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,765.12,"jacinda ardern has"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,766.959,"given the undertaking that they might"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,769.36,"first and foremost try and"

8hy-OYsvhHQ,775.04,"going again in tonga as soon as possible"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,777.92,"and chirien are you able at all to"

8hy-OYsvhHQ,783.279,"tonga"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,785.519,"um"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,786.399,"we're still waiting for it would be"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,789.6,"premature of me to assume but you can"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,792.48,"imagine these uh tsunami waves from a"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,795.44,"volcano that was"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,797.36,"very very close to the most populous"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,800.0,"island which is which has about a"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,801.44,"hundred thousand people"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,803.04,"um and tonga is not uh is a flat land"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,807.68,"you can't as they describe it you can't"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,810.16,"you can imagine these waves coming"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,811.839,"through but there's no tall structures"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,813.6,"or mountains or hills that stand in the"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,815.36,"waves of standing the way of the waves"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,817.68,"and people so"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,819.68,"we can only imagine the destruction"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,821.199,"there's"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,822.24,"as we've seen through some pictures uh"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,825.36,"water waves that's gone up to hitting"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,828.56,"almost to the top of houses"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,831.44,"so when they when you think about when"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,834.0,"they say they have to run they don't"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,836.0,"have anywhere elevated to run to so they"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,838.959,"only have to run"
8hy-OYsvhHQ,840.56,"as further as they can inland"
8i5vL561ER8,0.03,"from here I am holding her down on her"
8i5vL561ER8,2.82,"wrist against the mattress she's not"

a5NXWi5vfXM,236.08,"thing i mean do you think there's any"

a5NXWi5vfXM,254.959,"gonna happen yeah uh henry cejudo's been"
a5NXWi5vfXM,257.519,"speaking out a little bit a little"
a5NXWi5vfXM,258.56,"frustrated that maybe he didn't get a"
a5NXWi5vfXM,260.079,"look at the title shot and feels like"
a5NXWi5vfXM,262.079,"maybe you guys aren't willing to pay"
a5NXWi5vfXM,263.68,"what is that guy retired"
a5NXWi5vfXM,266.32,"he's retired isn't he i mean the last"
a5NXWi5vfXM,268.8,"time i saw he was retired"
a5NXWi5vfXM,270.96,"and now he's mad that he didn't get a"
a5NXWi5vfXM,272.4,"title shot that doesn't even make sense"
a5NXWi5vfXM,275.6,"in a different weight class"
a5NXWi5vfXM,277.84,"it doesn't make sense"
a5NXWi5vfXM,279.84,"the example that everybody points to"
a5NXWi5vfXM,281.199,"obviously is george st pierre and said"
a5NXWi5vfXM,282.639,"well you gave him that opportunity prior"
a5NXWi5vfXM,284.479,"why wouldn't you do it you know tendered"
a5NXWi5vfXM,285.919,"up again is it yeah so i should have"
a5NXWi5vfXM,288.0,"jumped over everybody and gave it to him"
a5NXWi5vfXM,290.0,"because all of a sudden last week he"
a5NXWi5vfXM,291.52,"decided he's not retired"
a5NXWi5vfXM,293.36,"come on man this is a [ __ ] silly"
a5NXWi5vfXM,294.88,"conversation silly"
a5NXWi5vfXM,297.36,"he wants to come back and and and try to"
a5NXWi5vfXM,299.44,"win the title again in his weight class"
a5NXWi5vfXM,301.12,"and then"
a5NXWi5vfXM,302.0,"talk about moving up or doing something"
a5NXWi5vfXM,303.68,"else but you know just [ __ ]"
a5NXWi5vfXM,306.08,"pop up and start calling somebody names"
a5NXWi5vfXM,307.84,"and think that you're going to get a"
a5NXWi5vfXM,308.8,"title shot in a different weight class"
a5NXWi5vfXM,310.24,"when you've been retired for"
a5NXWi5vfXM,311.919,"what two two and a half years"
a5NXWi5vfXM,316.479,"last question for me i want to ask"
a5NXWi5vfXM,317.759,"obviously the pay-per-view price"
a5NXWi5vfXM,318.96,"changing everybody's kind of up in arms"
a5NXWi5vfXM,320.56,"about that i know that's an espn"
a5NXWi5vfXM,322.24,"decision but do you guys have any input"
a5NXWi5vfXM,324.4,"in that at all do you ever say like hey"
a5NXWi5vfXM,325.6,"maybe that's a little too much for the"
a5NXWi5vfXM,326.88,"consumer we don't we we don't have any"
a5NXWi5vfXM,329.36,"say in that you know we we we uh"
a5NXWi5vfXM,332.0,"we gave the the pay-per-views to espn so"
a5NXWi5vfXM,334.8,"yeah that's that's their decision you"
a5NXWi5vfXM,336.16,"know how i feel about that stuff i don't"
a5NXWi5vfXM,338.4,"i don't i don't love when when prices"
a5NXWi5vfXM,340.96,"get raised but it's not my decision it's"
a5NXWi5vfXM,343.12,"theirs"
a5NXWi5vfXM,345.12,"dana um can you comment on the pressure"
a5NXWi5vfXM,347.28,"that cater put on it seemed like you"
a5NXWi5vfXM,348.639,"know his forward pressure was so much"
a5NXWi5vfXM,350.4,"that gigga just basically couldn't fight"
a5NXWi5vfXM,352.479,"his fight you know he couldn't throw the"
a5NXWi5vfXM,353.6,"kicks and and whatnot uh that was the"
a5NXWi5vfXM,355.68,"difference did you think yeah i think"
a5NXWi5vfXM,357.44,"that you know there's a couple things"
a5NXWi5vfXM,359.6,"that i think affected the fight"
a5NXWi5vfXM,360.96,"obviously the first round"
a5NXWi5vfXM,362.639,"the wrestling and the grappling that"
a5NXWi5vfXM,364.24,"happened in that first round and then uh"
a5NXWi5vfXM,366.479,"that spinning elbow he hit him with"
a5NXWi5vfXM,368.96,"i i think that stuff really"
a5NXWi5vfXM,372.08,"turned the tide of the fight for calvin"
a5NXWi5vfXM,374.08,"cater and and you're absolutely right he"
a5NXWi5vfXM,376.479,"kept constant pressure on him he stayed"
a5NXWi5vfXM,378.24,"in his face he kept moving him backwards"
a5NXWi5vfXM,380.72,"and uh"
a5NXWi5vfXM,382.56,"you know"
a5NXWi5vfXM,383.36,"it looked like giga was out of it"
a5NXWi5vfXM,385.44,"halfway through the second round"
a5NXWi5vfXM,388.0,"the one thing you know a lot of guys"
a5NXWi5vfXM,389.52,"were slipping and you know gigaslipped"
a5NXWi5vfXM,391.44,"you know he had that great opening"
a5NXWi5vfXM,392.56,"flurry some kicks some punches seemed"
a5NXWi5vfXM,394.72,"like he was doing pretty well and he"
a5NXWi5vfXM,395.919,"slips and then the the whole fight"
a5NXWi5vfXM,397.52,"changes for him um"
a5NXWi5vfXM,399.52,"is there something going on with the"
a5NXWi5vfXM,400.72,"octagon now there was a lot of guys"
a5NXWi5vfXM,402.16,"tonight that slipped roy val a couple"
a5NXWi5vfXM,404.08,"times slipped"
a5NXWi5vfXM,405.199,"you know have you heard guys complain"
a5NXWi5vfXM,406.88,"about it or anything"
a5NXWi5vfXM,408.8,"no um and if you ask any of the guys to"
a5NXWi5vfXM,411.28,"fight in there that canvas is"
a5NXWi5vfXM,413.68,"you fall down on that canvas"
a5NXWi5vfXM,416.0,"to guys like you and me it's like road"
a5NXWi5vfXM,418.319,"rash it's like it's like falling down on"
a5NXWi5vfXM,420.4,"the pavement that's how coarse that that"
a5NXWi5vfXM,423.199,"that is and the reason it is like that"
a5NXWi5vfXM,425.039,"is for"
a5NXWi5vfXM,426.639,"when they're striking they don't slip"
a5NXWi5vfXM,428.88,"i i mean you can't get it any nastier"
a5NXWi5vfXM,430.96,"that the canvas can't be any nastier"
a5NXWi5vfXM,432.639,"than it is"
a5NXWi5vfXM,434.319,"but you you did notice that though that"
a5NXWi5vfXM,436.08,"there were a number of guys i didn't no"
a5NXWi5vfXM,437.759,"i i didn't notice that but they were"
a5NXWi5vfXM,439.84,"slipping yeah because roy vaughal"
a5NXWi5vfXM,441.52,"slipped a couple of times uh you know"
a5NXWi5vfXM,443.68,"obviously gigaslipped uh"
a5NXWi5vfXM,445.84,"did you ask any of the guys that came"
a5NXWi5vfXM,447.199,"out tonight if well since i've been here"
a5NXWi5vfXM,449.36,"there weren't anybody in here"
a5NXWi5vfXM,450.88,"oh oh yeah oh am i the only guy tonight"

a5NXWi5vfXM,457.84,"trust me this one"
a5NXWi5vfXM,459.28,"and then"
a5NXWi5vfXM,460.639,"dana my final question for you um you"
a5NXWi5vfXM,462.56,"know and i said this to calvin when i"
a5NXWi5vfXM,463.84,"talked to him but i wanted to get your"
a5NXWi5vfXM,465.039,"thought"
a5NXWi5vfXM,465.919,"the fact that he took as long off as he"
a5NXWi5vfXM,467.759,"did a lot of times guys get beat up as"
a5NXWi5vfXM,469.44,"badly as he did and they want to get"
a5NXWi5vfXM,471.28,"back in and they come back fast the fact"
a5NXWi5vfXM,473.039,"that he took off a year do you think"
a5NXWi5vfXM,474.8,"that played a part in how he looked"
a5NXWi5vfXM,476.56,"tonight because he you know he let"
a5NXWi5vfXM,478.16,"himself recover and his body wasn't"
a5NXWi5vfXM,479.919,"still beat up the way it was before i"
a5NXWi5vfXM,482.319,"think after that fight he had with with"
a5NXWi5vfXM,484.72,"max you got to take a year off i think"
a5NXWi5vfXM,487.199,"you have to"
a5NXWi5vfXM,488.479,"um"
a5NXWi5vfXM,491.44,"the answer yes it absolutely positively"
a5NXWi5vfXM,494.0,"did and he absolutely positively needed"
a5NXWi5vfXM,496.16,"to take that that time off"
a5NXWi5vfXM,499.28,"hi dana hi um when caitlin came back"
a5NXWi5vfXM,501.919,"here she mentioned that she wanted to"
a5NXWi5vfXM,503.52,"renegotiate her contract before this"
a5NXWi5vfXM,505.599,"fight and that she wasn't able to um do"
a5NXWi5vfXM,507.84,"you have plans to resign her do you"
a5NXWi5vfXM,509.199,"think that that who did caitlyn jackagan"
a5NXWi5vfXM,511.52,"yeah yeah yeah um"
a5NXWi5vfXM,513.68,"yeah i know that"
a5NXWi5vfXM,515.12,"we went into this fight"

AaW7z4DPECw,75.28,"but the idea is going to be the same we"
AaW7z4DPECw,77.52,"just have to figure out the path to"
AaW7z4DPECw,79.04,"getting to this escape so"
AaW7z4DPECw,80.4,"all of these things can be escaped using"
AaW7z4DPECw,82.96,"the upper that we're going to show you"
AaW7z4DPECw,84.24,"today"
AaW7z4DPECw,84.72,"but for today let's start with the"
AaW7z4DPECw,86.4,"standard one hands on the neck"
AaW7z4DPECw,88.799,"now when i put my hands on her neck and"
AaW7z4DPECw,90.72,"this is a serious situation"
AaW7z4DPECw,92.479,"i absolutely expect some sort of"
AaW7z4DPECw,95.119,"reaction"
AaW7z4DPECw,96.0,"i can tell you guys this though i don't"
AaW7z4DPECw,98.24,"expect"
AaW7z4DPECw,99.119,"her to grab my hand like this one and"
AaW7z4DPECw,102.0,"two"
AaW7z4DPECw,102.72,"i expect punching i expect kicking maybe"
AaW7z4DPECw,105.52,"even reaching to grab the groin"
AaW7z4DPECw,107.36,"all of those things are possibilities"
AaW7z4DPECw,109.52,"but the last of my worries"
AaW7z4DPECw,111.2,"is two quick holds let's look at those"
AaW7z4DPECw,113.52,"holes so number one"
AaW7z4DPECw,114.96,"she's going to take her right hand and"
AaW7z4DPECw,116.159,"cover my right watch it's important that"
AaW7z4DPECw,118.56,"she puts this low"
AaW7z4DPECw,119.84,"as low as she can as close to my watch"
AaW7z4DPECw,122.159,"as possible"
AaW7z4DPECw,123.04,"the reason is i'm going to be wanting to"
AaW7z4DPECw,125.04,"put my hand out on the floor pretty soon"
AaW7z4DPECw,127.119,"and with that hook that monkey grip it"
AaW7z4DPECw,129.36,"won't go now use a c"
AaW7z4DPECw,130.72,"grip what is the difference monkey grip"
AaW7z4DPECw,132.239,"is here c grip"
AaW7z4DPECw,133.84,"is here when she uses a c grip there's"
AaW7z4DPECw,136.0,"an opening"
AaW7z4DPECw,136.959,"on that side and look i might be able to"
AaW7z4DPECw,139.68,"post my hand when the bump eventually"
AaW7z4DPECw,141.44,"happens so right now"
AaW7z4DPECw,142.72,"monkey grip the back side is another way"
AaW7z4DPECw,145.12,"that i could possibly pull away if she"
AaW7z4DPECw,146.56,"didn't have that there"
AaW7z4DPECw,147.599,"and i did think that this might be"
AaW7z4DPECw,149.04,"something i could pull back like so"
AaW7z4DPECw,150.879,"okay but if she grabs the back of my arm"
AaW7z4DPECw,153.12,"and sort of pulls in"
AaW7z4DPECw,154.4,"engaging her back muscles this feels"
AaW7z4DPECw,156.72,"very strong with both of these holds"
AaW7z4DPECw,158.56,"okay next she's going to take her foot"
AaW7z4DPECw,161.519,"and trap"
AaW7z4DPECw,162.239,"my foot now notice how she also kind of"
AaW7z4DPECw,164.72,"narrows my foot inward because if it's"
AaW7z4DPECw,166.64,"out there"
AaW7z4DPECw,167.599,"she could be over it but there could"
AaW7z4DPECw,169.44,"still be a possibility"
AaW7z4DPECw,170.879,"of my foot basing i'll be honest with"
AaW7z4DPECw,172.959,"you guys it's very"
AaW7z4DPECw,174.16,"unlikely because as an attacker i'm not"
AaW7z4DPECw,176.72,"thinking about basing and so on"
AaW7z4DPECw,178.56,"i'm thinking about attacking so i'm"
AaW7z4DPECw,180.4,"going to be going forward leaning"
AaW7z4DPECw,182.239,"and that's probably gonna work whether"
AaW7z4DPECw,183.76,"she does it correct or not but let's do"
AaW7z4DPECw,185.599,"it correctly so the footsteps over"
AaW7z4DPECw,187.44,"the foot narrows in and essentially"
AaW7z4DPECw,189.76,"right now she's trapped my entire"
AaW7z4DPECw,191.84,"right side okay now the next part is"
AaW7z4DPECw,195.36,"super important we're gonna do it once"
AaW7z4DPECw,197.28,"and then she's gonna show you how it's"
AaW7z4DPECw,198.56,"done without a partner so that you guys"
AaW7z4DPECw,200.0,"can see how the hips work okay"
AaW7z4DPECw,201.76,"so her opposite leg is gonna go in the"
AaW7z4DPECw,204.0,"middle of everything and be planted on"
AaW7z4DPECw,205.68,"the ground"
AaW7z4DPECw,206.4,"the closer that leg is to her bottom the"
AaW7z4DPECw,208.799,"higher the lift of the hips"
AaW7z4DPECw,210.72,"okay now from here she starts to bridge"
AaW7z4DPECw,213.599,"and i want to pose but i cannot now she"
AaW7z4DPECw,215.84,"turns"
AaW7z4DPECw,216.319,"freeze perfect she's on top now here's"
AaW7z4DPECw,219.519,"what's most important from here"
AaW7z4DPECw,221.84,"if she stands up and does not have base"
AaW7z4DPECw,224.64,"i could pull her back to me"
AaW7z4DPECw,226.319,"the choke is kind of useless right now"
AaW7z4DPECw,228.0,"right you could posture up"
AaW7z4DPECw,229.68,"but look at this if she steps up and she"
AaW7z4DPECw,231.76,"has her feet wide"
AaW7z4DPECw,233.599,"then a pool can bring her right back to"
AaW7z4DPECw,236.159,"me"
AaW7z4DPECw,236.879,"if she steps up and she turns her base"
AaW7z4DPECw,238.879,"perpendicular turns sideways"
AaW7z4DPECw,241.2,"now that pull is not going to work very"
AaW7z4DPECw,243.84,"well"
AaW7z4DPECw,244.48,"and now she could rip it back and pull"
AaW7z4DPECw,246.319,"away from the situation okay"
AaW7z4DPECw,247.92,"let's take a look at this by yourself"
AaW7z4DPECw,249.92,"result so she's going to lie down here"
AaW7z4DPECw,252.159,"she's going to imagine trapping the arm"
AaW7z4DPECw,254.159,"okay she's also going to trap the same"
AaW7z4DPECw,256.0,"side leg which is"
AaW7z4DPECw,257.28,"very important right next this leg is"
AaW7z4DPECw,259.68,"going to be the bridging leg that goes"
AaW7z4DPECw,260.959,"in the center"
AaW7z4DPECw,262.16,"and now she's going to start to elevate"
AaW7z4DPECw,264.0,"the hips and turn over her"
AaW7z4DPECw,265.44,"shoulder right to her knees just like"
AaW7z4DPECw,267.68,"that okay let's do it again"
AaW7z4DPECw,269.919,"so from here okay the hand goes across"
AaW7z4DPECw,274.479,"the throat she grabs number one and"
AaW7z4DPECw,276.16,"grabs number two"
AaW7z4DPECw,277.6,"traps the foot okay now from here she's"
AaW7z4DPECw,280.56,"gonna start to put the other one right"
AaW7z4DPECw,281.919,"in the center that's very important"
AaW7z4DPECw,283.04,"because watch this"
AaW7z4DPECw,284.16,"if we turn a little bit and she traps my"
AaW7z4DPECw,286.88,"right foot but then traps my left"
AaW7z4DPECw,289.04,"foot and begins to bridge with this"
AaW7z4DPECw,291.68,"being trapped this can help me"
AaW7z4DPECw,293.36,"hook myself i'm not going anywhere right"
AaW7z4DPECw,296.32,"maybe they get lucky"
AaW7z4DPECw,297.44,"and all they do is just lock their legs"
AaW7z4DPECw,299.44,"tightly and then that's going to keep me"
AaW7z4DPECw,300.72,"in this position okay"
AaW7z4DPECw,301.919,"so it's important that she doesn't do"
AaW7z4DPECw,303.36,"that on the second side she only traps"
AaW7z4DPECw,305.52,"here"
AaW7z4DPECw,305.919,"and then the other one in the middle"
AaW7z4DPECw,307.6,"exactly now from here the bridge occurs"
AaW7z4DPECw,309.759,"go"
AaW7z4DPECw,310.88,"turn boom pops up sideways and gets away"
AaW7z4DPECw,314.72,"just like that okay so this needs to be"
AaW7z4DPECw,317.28,"practiced a lot of people would say wait"
AaW7z4DPECw,318.88,"a second"
AaW7z4DPECw,319.759,"how am i ever going to remember these"
AaW7z4DPECw,322.24,"techniques"
AaW7z4DPECw,323.36,"in the heat of the moment and i would"
AaW7z4DPECw,325.199,"agree with you watching a video is a"
AaW7z4DPECw,327.199,"great"
AaW7z4DPECw,327.84,"start okay but after that you guys are"
AaW7z4DPECw,330.4,"going to have to put in some repetitions"
AaW7z4DPECw,332.24,"we often joke and say that in brazilian"
AaW7z4DPECw,334.639,"jiu jitsu you got to do the move how"
AaW7z4DPECw,336.16,"many times"
AaW7z4DPECw,338.0,"a brazilian times okay and that's pretty"
AaW7z4DPECw,341.12,"much the truth you guys got to do"
AaW7z4DPECw,342.4,"repetition to the point where you don't"
AaW7z4DPECw,343.759,"have to think about it"
AaW7z4DPECw,345.12,"it just happens okay let's do maybe one"
AaW7z4DPECw,347.36,"or two more regular speed"
AaW7z4DPECw,348.72,"so from here let's move back a little"
AaW7z4DPECw,352.0,"so mount position for me trap"
AaW7z4DPECw,355.12,"trap foot in the middle brick pop"
AaW7z4DPECw,358.319,"up and get home safe very good and once"
AaW7z4DPECw,361.199,"more"
AaW7z4DPECw,363.12,"let's do a tiny bit of a different angle"
AaW7z4DPECw,364.88,"maybe this way"
AaW7z4DPECw,366.4,"okay same thing trap"
AaW7z4DPECw,370.56,"trap bridge i can't post she pops up"
AaW7z4DPECw,374.479,"and she's gone so the idea"
AaW7z4DPECw,378.24,"is that this is what we call the"
AaW7z4DPECw,379.759,"standard umpa or standard"
AaW7z4DPECw,382.16,"trap and roll and later all the other"
AaW7z4DPECw,384.56,"instances that we talked about"
AaW7z4DPECw,385.84,"punches wrist pins all of that stuff"
AaW7z4DPECw,388.319,"will eventually come back to this escape"
AaW7z4DPECw,390.56,"so this is a super"
AaW7z4DPECw,391.6,"important one to know we hope that you"
AaW7z4DPECw,393.6,"guys enjoyed it"
AaW7z4DPECw,394.72,"and we'll be back very very soon with"
AaW7z4DPECw,396.56,"another video if you guys did like it"
AaW7z4DPECw,398.96,"please feel free to comment on the video"
AaW7z4DPECw,400.96,"leave us a like and make sure you"
AaW7z4DPECw,402.319,"subscribe to our channel"

AaW7z4DPECw,405.199,"safe out there and we'll see you soon"
AaW7z4DPECw,410.54,"[Music]"
AaW7z4DPECw,419.32,"[Music]"
AaW7z4DPECw,428.88,"you"
ABNjmDgFwcs,0.08,"hey guys today we're going to talk about"
ABNjmDgFwcs,1.76,"buck trap and roll which is"
ABNjmDgFwcs,3.199,"a solution for you being on the bottom"
ABNjmDgFwcs,5.44,"and somebody else being mounted on top"
ABNjmDgFwcs,7.279,"of you while you're on the ground"
ABNjmDgFwcs,8.72,"this is one that we commonly teach in"
ABNjmDgFwcs,10.4,"our women's self-defense seminars"
ABNjmDgFwcs,12.16,"and we'll often even add in"
ABNjmDgFwcs,15.44,"choke from the ground when someone's"
ABNjmDgFwcs,17.52,"mounted on top of you and choking that's"
ABNjmDgFwcs,18.96,"not in this video but drop us a comment"
ABNjmDgFwcs,20.88,"to let us know"
ABNjmDgFwcs,21.68,"if you want to see a video with that one"
ABNjmDgFwcs,24.0,"hey guys andy here from colorado now"
ABNjmDgFwcs,26.16,"we're going to talk today about this"
ABNjmDgFwcs,27.599,"situation here"
ABNjmDgFwcs,28.8,"obviously he's in a bit of an advantage"
ABNjmDgFwcs,30.88,"here and i'm going to disadvantage so"
ABNjmDgFwcs,32.8,"we need to talk about some"
ABNjmDgFwcs,34.04,"considerations right off the bat"
ABNjmDgFwcs,36.559,"about uh my positioning here now my feet"
ABNjmDgFwcs,39.44,"are touched really close"
ABNjmDgFwcs,40.719,"to my body this gives me some leverage"
ABNjmDgFwcs,43.04,"with my hips so that i can drive them up"
ABNjmDgFwcs,45.28,"off the ground and if my feet are hot i"
ABNjmDgFwcs,48.079,"don't get that leverage at all so that's"
ABNjmDgFwcs,49.76,"an issue"
ABNjmDgFwcs,50.399,"i keep my feet close to my body to get"
ABNjmDgFwcs,52.879,"that power"
ABNjmDgFwcs,53.52,"my head is up off the ground to protect"
ABNjmDgFwcs,55.199,"the back of my head from any incidental"
ABNjmDgFwcs,57.44,"uh damage and secondary trauma um from"
ABNjmDgFwcs,60.0,"the ground itself he punches me in the"
ABNjmDgFwcs,61.6,"face"
ABNjmDgFwcs,62.079,"and the back of my head hits the floor"
ABNjmDgFwcs,63.76,"and i'm getting two blood flows intact"
ABNjmDgFwcs,65.84,"at once which is not good"
ABNjmDgFwcs,67.36,"um i want to keep my elbows tucked in"
ABNjmDgFwcs,69.52,"tight so that i'm"
ABNjmDgFwcs,70.88,"digging them into his thighs and this"
ABNjmDgFwcs,73.04,"helps keep him where"
ABNjmDgFwcs,74.159,"he's at which is over my hips which"
ABNjmDgFwcs,76.08,"gives me the most leverage in this"
ABNjmDgFwcs,78.159,"position which is what i want"
ABNjmDgFwcs,79.92,"if my elbows start to slip out then i'm"
ABNjmDgFwcs,82.32,"giving him more freedom to"
ABNjmDgFwcs,83.92,"scoot up where i can't leverage him with"
ABNjmDgFwcs,86.64,"my hips"
ABNjmDgFwcs,87.2,"as much which isn't so let's talk about"
ABNjmDgFwcs,89.759,"him punching me in the face from him"
ABNjmDgFwcs,91.52,"i might be needing to cover but i need"
ABNjmDgFwcs,93.52,"him to stop hitting me more than"
ABNjmDgFwcs,94.799,"anything"
ABNjmDgFwcs,95.28,"so i'm gonna do what's called bucking"
ABNjmDgFwcs,97.28,"where i buff my hips up"
ABNjmDgFwcs,99.52,"to try to get him to tip over"
ABNjmDgFwcs,102.64,"one good information that we have here"
ABNjmDgFwcs,104.479,"when the piece of information we have"
ABNjmDgFwcs,105.92,"here"
ABNjmDgFwcs,106.32,"is if his hands are on the floor i know"
ABNjmDgFwcs,108.399,"he's not punching me so i could use that"
ABNjmDgFwcs,110.799,"right but it's likely he'll sit back up"
ABNjmDgFwcs,113.04,"and he'll start striking me again so"
ABNjmDgFwcs,114.64,"it's not just one buck but it's gonna be"
ABNjmDgFwcs,116.56,"a series of bucks that's trying to keep"
ABNjmDgFwcs,118.96,"him from hitting it"
ABNjmDgFwcs,120.96,"just remember"
ABNjmDgFwcs,124.719,"buck like a mother bucker that'll help"
ABNjmDgFwcs,126.96,"keep him from punching you in the face"
ABNjmDgFwcs,128.959,"right"
ABNjmDgFwcs,129.599,"so now that i've learned how to keep him"
ABNjmDgFwcs,132.239,"from hitting me just for a second"
ABNjmDgFwcs,133.92,"i need to work on bettering my positions"
ABNjmDgFwcs,136.239,"i'm still not in a great place here"
ABNjmDgFwcs,138.0,"so once i've tipped his weight forward"
ABNjmDgFwcs,140.48,"and"
ABNjmDgFwcs,141.12,"throws in here so i can demonstrate to"
ABNjmDgFwcs,142.72,"you but he probably would be sitting"
ABNjmDgFwcs,144.56,"back up"
ABNjmDgFwcs,145.599,"once i bucked his weight forward i need"
ABNjmDgFwcs,148.4,"to trap"
ABNjmDgFwcs,150.16,"this side of his body i need to collect"
ABNjmDgFwcs,152.319,"this arm and i need to prohibit his legs"
ABNjmDgFwcs,154.64,"from being able to move out"
ABNjmDgFwcs,156.16,"so that i can then wall and"
ABNjmDgFwcs,159.2,"set myself up to be in a better position"
ABNjmDgFwcs,161.44,"here there's a couple things that happen"
ABNjmDgFwcs,163.12,"all at once so let's kind of reverse"
ABNjmDgFwcs,164.56,"we'll talk about it"
ABNjmDgFwcs,168.16,"i buck his weight forward so that"
ABNjmDgFwcs,171.519,"his hands are now supporting him um but"
ABNjmDgFwcs,174.879,"like i said he's gonna be sitting back"
ABNjmDgFwcs,176.64,"up so in that moment when he hits the"
ABNjmDgFwcs,179.12,"ground"
ABNjmDgFwcs,179.68,"i have to take action i can't wait full"
ABNjmDgFwcs,182.159,"speed it looks like this"
ABNjmDgFwcs,187.2,"i can't wait once his hands hit the"
ABNjmDgFwcs,189.28,"ground i need to use that second to tip"
ABNjmDgFwcs,191.68,"him over so once he's in that"
ABNjmDgFwcs,193.68,"position on all fours up there bust him"
ABNjmDgFwcs,196.08,"over he's like a table"
ABNjmDgFwcs,197.599,"if i cut off one leg of the table and i"
ABNjmDgFwcs,199.68,"cut off another leg of the table"
ABNjmDgFwcs,201.2,"the table is going to be able to tip in"
ABNjmDgFwcs,202.56,"this direction it's not actually the"
ABNjmDgFwcs,204.879,"strength that i'm using to knock back"
ABNjmDgFwcs,207.68,"over and have us both roll in this"
ABNjmDgFwcs,209.36,"direction"
ABNjmDgFwcs,210.159,"just leverage i buff my hips up again"
ABNjmDgFwcs,212.799,"the same thing that we did"
ABNjmDgFwcs,214.239,"when i was trying to keep him from"
ABNjmDgFwcs,215.68,"hitting me and this tips us in that"
ABNjmDgFwcs,217.92,"direction"
ABNjmDgFwcs,219.04,"if i fail at trapping this arm or this"
ABNjmDgFwcs,222.239,"leg"
ABNjmDgFwcs,222.959,"watch what zach does right i've walked"
ABNjmDgFwcs,224.959,"him over to here i trap this leg"
ABNjmDgFwcs,226.879,"if i try to roll this direction yeah you"
ABNjmDgFwcs,229.12,"can use that hand"
ABNjmDgFwcs,230.56,"to base out and that keeps us from"
ABNjmDgFwcs,233.36,"rolling which is not what i want at all"
ABNjmDgFwcs,235.36,"let's say i did a good job of trapping"
ABNjmDgFwcs,236.959,"this arm but i failed at trapping the"
ABNjmDgFwcs,238.799,"leg"
ABNjmDgFwcs,239.36,"i try to roll this over to use that foot"
ABNjmDgFwcs,242.159,"to base out which is again not what i"
ABNjmDgFwcs,244.08,"want"
ABNjmDgFwcs,244.56,"so that's why we need to trap both of"
ABNjmDgFwcs,246.799,"them at the same time"
ABNjmDgFwcs,248.879,"right before we buck again so that we"
ABNjmDgFwcs,251.28,"can roll over and of course i roll with"
ABNjmDgFwcs,253.04,"him stick with him"
ABNjmDgFwcs,254.08,"i might even still have his his ankles"
ABNjmDgFwcs,256.4,"crossed behind my back"
ABNjmDgFwcs,257.759,"and have to do some things to loosen"
ABNjmDgFwcs,259.68,"that up so that i can"
ABNjmDgFwcs,260.959,"get out of this position once he's"
ABNjmDgFwcs,263.44,"loosened up a little bit i'm gonna put"
ABNjmDgFwcs,264.88,"my hands on his knees"
ABNjmDgFwcs,266.16,"i'm gonna keep his feet from kicking me"
ABNjmDgFwcs,268.8,"as i get up now"
ABNjmDgFwcs,289.44,"so from this position i may or may not"
ABNjmDgFwcs,291.6,"be able to punch him from here"
ABNjmDgFwcs,294.0,"of course i do have this strain strike"
ABNjmDgFwcs,296.479,"available"
ABNjmDgFwcs,297.199,"it's not gonna it's not gonna kill him"
ABNjmDgFwcs,299.68,"i'm not gonna hurt him that much"
ABNjmDgFwcs,301.039,"but i might be able to bait him into"
ABNjmDgFwcs,303.68,"coming down further"
ABNjmDgFwcs,305.199,"wow with some what a strike like i might"

ABNjmDgFwcs,368.72,"collect his arm this way it's a little"
ABNjmDgFwcs,370.479,"slower but this is a more secure hole"
ABNjmDgFwcs,372.96,"not a comfy grip or anything you can"
ABNjmDgFwcs,375.199,"pull his arm out"
ABNjmDgFwcs,376.16,"if he wants it but it gives me a little"

ABNjmDgFwcs,379.28,"you could also send both arms to the"
ABNjmDgFwcs,381.6,"same side at once"
ABNjmDgFwcs,383.12,"and collect his arm like this it's a lot"
ABNjmDgFwcs,385.28,"more control because i've got two on one"

aoXJfuPaFF8,Welcome back to Smarter Every Day, OK,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,2.485,"We are kicking off the Coast"
aoXJfuPaFF8,Guard series in full effect here.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,6.773,"Today, we want to get to the good stuff."
aoXJfuPaFF8,8.158,"We're gonna start learning"
aoXJfuPaFF8,about search and rescue.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,10.31,"And when you think about the Coast Guard,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,12.112,"you normally think about like an airplane,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,well, it's a helicopter.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,15.532,"I'm sorry, a helicopter like this"
aoXJfuPaFF8,17.25,"or you think of a RBM"
aoXJfuPaFF8,like this, a response boat medium.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,20.537,"These things are awesome,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and they're used effectively by the Coast,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,24.207,"Guard to save lives for"
aoXJfuPaFF8,what's called SAR search and rescue.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,28.128,"But today, what I want to do"
aoXJfuPaFF8,is I'm going to focus on the search part,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,31.848,"of search and rescue,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,because we don't really think about that.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,34.35,"Sometimes we think about like,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,35.602,"you get the helicopter"
aoXJfuPaFF8,coming over the horizon, going,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,37.587,"down, picking"
aoXJfuPaFF8,somebody up, we'll do that in the future.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,39.773,"But how do they know where to go?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,41.491,"This Deep Dove series into the US"
aoXJfuPaFF8,Coast Guard is incredible,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,44.661,"because I had no idea that the Coast Guard"
aoXJfuPaFF8,did so many different awesome things.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,49.382,"Today we're going to focus on"
aoXJfuPaFF8,how the US Coast Guard uses,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,52.168,"math and science"
aoXJfuPaFF8,to find people in the ocean.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,56.189,"Let's go get smarter every day."
aoXJfuPaFF8,71.932,"So on our last video on the coast guard we visited sector mobile"
aoXJfuPaFF8,74.207,"Mobile on the Gulf Coast of Alabama,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,where we saw a command center at work.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,78.144,"We also met with Captain Allen,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,who's in charge of Sector Mobile,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,81.114,"which means she's in charge"
aoXJfuPaFF8,of all the Coast Guard,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,83.032,"assets along a vast stretch of the Gulf"
aoXJfuPaFF8,Coast of the United States.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,86.369,"I asked her about how they approach"
aoXJfuPaFF8,finding people who are lost,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,89.456,"when you dispatch."
aoXJfuPaFF8,90.807,"Your air assets or."
aoXJfuPaFF8,92.809,"Boats or whatever you dispatch."
aoXJfuPaFF8,94.711,"Do you have them search in a certain way?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,97.163,"We do."
aoXJfuPaFF8,97.764,"We have various search patterns"
aoXJfuPaFF8,depending on the search search object.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,102.602,"We put various search objects in there"
aoXJfuPaFF8,because sometimes,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,105.989,"we don't know for search"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and for cutting cabin boat,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,109.859,"whether a swamped capsized boat,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,they all float differently.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,114.297,"A person in the water,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,115.398,"a person with a life jacket,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,a person with without a life jacket.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,119.269,"We do various searches"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and we put different assets,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,123.139,"on different patterns"
aoXJfuPaFF8,so that we're covering that whole area.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,127.043,"That drift is what we call it."
aoXJfuPaFF8,129.496," really? So, so a person in the water with a life jacket"
aoXJfuPaFF8,131.514,"Is going to float different than"
aoXJfuPaFF8,just a flat bottomed boat in the water.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,134.968,"That's correct."
aoXJfuPaFF8,Destin  -  In what way?,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,136.97,"Destin  -  How would that be different?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,137.837,"Well, it depends on the current surface"
aoXJfuPaFF8,currents, underwater currents,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,143.493,"and then also the air"
aoXJfuPaFF8,which direction the air is.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,148.548,"Destin  -  Oh, because the water could be flowing,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,150.116,"Destin  -  one way in the air"
aoXJfuPaFF8,could be following the other.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,151.618,"Destin  -  What does that do?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,152.368,"We put it all into the SAR database,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and it's usually spits,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,156.539,"out a great product for us"
aoXJfuPaFF8,that we can base our search patterns on.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,160.493,"It'll put out a search pattern."
aoXJfuPaFF8,162.862,"Various search patterns."
aoXJfuPaFF8,164.447,"And we give those to our boats."
aoXJfuPaFF8,166.699,"We give them to our air assets."
aoXJfuPaFF8,168.751,"We give them to everyone that's searching."
aoXJfuPaFF8,171.02,"OK, that was fascinating."
aoXJfuPaFF8,172.172,"The idea that different things"
aoXJfuPaFF8,float differently,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,175.408,"in the water and the way they float"
aoXJfuPaFF8,determines where they could be.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,178.728,"That's where the survivors are."
aoXJfuPaFF8,180.296,"That's crazy."
aoXJfuPaFF8,181.247,"OK, Captain Allen talked about this"
aoXJfuPaFF8,modeling,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,183.166,"and simulation software"
aoXJfuPaFF8,that the Coast Guard uses to find people.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,186.319,"And in the last episode,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,if you were paying close attention,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,189.172,"there was this really brief moment where"
aoXJfuPaFF8,there it is right there.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,191.641,"See it? OK, zoom in"
aoXJfuPaFF8,193.826,"and enhance."
aoXJfuPaFF8,194.694,"OK, so this is modeling and simulation"
aoXJfuPaFF8,software, so I'm using context clues here.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,199.515,"The purple things seem to be"
aoXJfuPaFF8,like simulations of probable locations,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,204.053,"where something may have drifted off"
aoXJfuPaFF8,or something like that.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,206.573,"And we're trying to find it."
aoXJfuPaFF8,207.574,"And so this black line"
aoXJfuPaFF8,seems like a search pattern,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,210.51,"and this first one makes sense to me"
aoXJfuPaFF8,because when I color something,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,214.047,"I start at one side and I'm methodically"
aoXJfuPaFF8,216.232,"covered the entire area"
aoXJfuPaFF8,all the way over to the other side.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,218.768,"Make sure I didn't miss anything,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,220.853,"but this other thing"
aoXJfuPaFF8,is a little strange to me.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,222.889,"I don't really, you know, it's"
aoXJfuPaFF8,not intuitive because it's like triangles,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,226.893,"and that doesn't seem"
aoXJfuPaFF8,like an efficient way to cover an area.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,229.762,"So what's going on with that?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,231.08,"This weird shape is a concept"
aoXJfuPaFF8,the Coast Guard uses called a Victor,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,234.867,"Sierra,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,otherwise known as a sector search.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,237.87,"It's always a very interesting problem"
aoXJfuPaFF8,that occurs when you search,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,240.657,"for someone on water."
aoXJfuPaFF8,241.975,"Let's say you went on a hike"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and you lost something.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,244.494,"The right thing to do"
aoXJfuPaFF8,is just go back to the last place,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,246.646,"you remember having your item,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and it's probably in that general area.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,250.35,"This works because land doesn't move."
aoXJfuPaFF8,253.069,"Water, however, does move, and it can even"
aoXJfuPaFF8,change flow directions over time.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,257.79,"If you were to go back to the same place"
aoXJfuPaFF8,where you lost the thing,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,260.576,"it's probably already"
aoXJfuPaFF8,drifted away on the water.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,263.162,"Understanding that drift"
aoXJfuPaFF8,that Captain Allen was talking about,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,266.215,"you remember when I did that, that drift,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,that's the key to finding people,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,269.902,"because I thought that the cases"
aoXJfuPaFF8,would just roll up in their boat,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,272.972,"and just start looking around,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,273.923,"maybe use a search light at night"
aoXJfuPaFF8,or something like that.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,276.442,"But no, they have to do two things"
aoXJfuPaFF8,really, really quickly.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,279.595,"They have to first"
aoXJfuPaFF8,find the drift of the water.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,282.832,"But they also have to start searching."
aoXJfuPaFF8,284.45,"And this Victor Sierra kind of does that."
aoXJfuPaFF8,286.552,"And the cool thing about Coast"
aoXJfuPaFF8,these is that their training,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,289.372,"is standardized, so it doesn't matter"
aoXJfuPaFF8,where you go, talk to a coastie,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,293.276,"They all know how this works."
aoXJfuPaFF8,295.278,"So what I'd like to do is"
aoXJfuPaFF8,I like to go talk to coasties,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,297.78,"from two different locations"
aoXJfuPaFF8,299.432,"and see if we can understand"
aoXJfuPaFF8,that we're actually going to do a Victor,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,302.268,"Sierra down here in Florida."
aoXJfuPaFF8,303.453,"But first, I want to go up to Station"
aoXJfuPaFF8,Rochester in New York on Lake Ontario.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,307.674,"This is bosun's mate second Class Lucas,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,Western,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,311.778,"Lucas and the rest of the crew showed me the RBM, a response boat medium"
aoXJfuPaFF8,that they used here at the station.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,315.515,"And once we went into the station,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,316.883,"I got a chance to ask them"
aoXJfuPaFF8,about what a Victor Sierra is.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,319.919,"So what we're doing for a victor"
aoXJfuPaFF8,Sierra sector search is,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,324.09,"we are trying to look for a small search"
aoXJfuPaFF8,object and very well known location.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,328.878,"Destin  -  OK"
aoXJfuPaFF8,329.634,"what you're doing with those triangles"
aoXJfuPaFF8,is your covering a small area a lot.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,334.817,"So as you're searching,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,336.285,"you're actually moving with the current"
aoXJfuPaFF8,or the winds to figure out how fast,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,340.406,"the water is moving,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,whether it's by wind or by currents.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,344.027,"And then the direction is moving"
aoXJfuPaFF8,the thought process behind it,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,346.729,"as if someone's fallen overboard."
aoXJfuPaFF8,348.498,"They're not going to drift"
aoXJfuPaFF8,against the wind or against the current.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,351.951,"So you want to follow the direction"
aoXJfuPaFF8,that they started to drift in.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,355.038,"If You don't speak."
aoXJfuPaFF8,355.738,"Coast Guard, it might be difficult"
aoXJfuPaFF8,to understand what he was saying.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,358.224,"So let's just go do one."
aoXJfuPaFF8,359.926,"Let's go down to Station Destin in Destin,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,Florida, and let's learn how to do it.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,364.647,"Victor Sierra search pattern."
aoXJfuPaFF8,366.199,"Obviously,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,I think Station Destin is really cool,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,368.701,"because my name is Destin, but the."
aoXJfuPaFF8,370.169,"Cool thing about this particular trip is"
aoXJfuPaFF8,I went on Memorial Day weekend,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,374.006,"which is the busiest weekend of the year"
aoXJfuPaFF8,for this station.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,377.193,"There's this little makeshift island"
aoXJfuPaFF8,that pops up just offshore from Station,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,380.797,"Destin called Crab Island, saw a bunch of"
aoXJfuPaFF8,people go party and all kinds of stuff.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,384.667,"It was a really interesting time"
aoXJfuPaFF8,385.985,"to visit at one point"
aoXJfuPaFF8,while hanging out in the cafeteria,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,388.271,"and just getting to know"
aoXJfuPaFF8,some of the coasties.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,389.856,"I learned one of the most important things"
aoXJfuPaFF8,that the Coast Guard taught me.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,393.393,"All right, so this is Justin."
aoXJfuPaFF8,394.894,"And he's going to teach me how to whistle"
aoXJfuPaFF8,because you whistle at the college. Kids, right?,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,397.146,"Yeah."
aoXJfuPaFF8,398.131,"So you're going to put your hands together"
aoXJfuPaFF8,to your guns.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,401.868,"I think you should line up finger guns."
aoXJfuPaFF8,404.02,"All right."
aoXJfuPaFF8,404.771,"Fingers together."
aoXJfuPaFF8,405.571,"Destin  -  Yeah."
aoXJfuPaFF8,406.422,"And all you do is you just"
aoXJfuPaFF8,push your tongue back and bang down.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,409.392,"Destin  -  Back? What do you mean?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,411.377,"Destin  -  Cause is. ( really really loud whistle sound )"
aoXJfuPaFF8,415.782,"Destin  -  hold on wait what did you do with your tongue?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,417.283,"Destin  -  let me see it ,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,419.048,"so you push it back."
aoXJfuPaFF8,419.78,"Destin - Uh-Huh."
aoXJfuPaFF8,420.403,"And fold it over,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,421.755,"Destin  - uh huh?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,422.435,"And you just blow"
aoXJfuPaFF8,424.24,"Destin  -  All right"
aoXJfuPaFF8,425.608,"alright you want to hold that?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,429.879,"finger guns like that."
aoXJfuPaFF8,431.581,"Justin  -  Yeah."
aoXJfuPaFF8,432.849,"Knuckles together...?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,433.77,"Justin  -  So your pinkies?  You see these two lines right here."
aoXJfuPaFF8,436.803,"Destin  -  Yeah."
aoXJfuPaFF8,437.616,"Justin  -  Line those up."
aoXJfuPaFF8,439.234,"Destin  -  OK. Got it!"
aoXJfuPaFF8,440.437,"Justin  -  OK, then fingers together"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and you want to hold your tongue over.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,443.826,"Destin  -  uh huh!"
aoXJfuPaFF8,Destin  -  ( Destin Whistles and is in pure amazement ),""
aoXJfuPaFF8,445.528,"Justin  -  And then blow down."
aoXJfuPaFF8,447.63,"Holy cow."
aoXJfuPaFF8,448.798,"Are you serious."
aoXJfuPaFF8,450.483,"DUDEEE ?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,451.567,"Justin  -  Once you get that down,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,you can do it with one hand the same way.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,454.587,"Destin  -  ( Freaking out ) are you serious?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,459.091,"Destin  -  ( whistles loudly )"
aoXJfuPaFF8,463.513,"Justin, thank you so much."
aoXJfuPaFF8,465.181,"Justin  -  you are welcome"
aoXJfuPaFF8,467.099,"There was a moment, dude."
aoXJfuPaFF8,468.367,"OK. Obviously, that was awesome."
aoXJfuPaFF8,470.62,"Anyway, the next day, before Crab Island"
aoXJfuPaFF8,started to form, I have to go see them,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,474.574,"prep one of the boats for the day."
aoXJfuPaFF8,476.075,"This is an RBM response boat medium."
aoXJfuPaFF8,478.928,"It's a 45 foot long jet boat, and this is"
aoXJfuPaFF8,one of the workhorses of the Coast Guard.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,483.149,"Ortize showed me"
aoXJfuPaFF8,some of the secrets of the boat,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,485.918,"as they were getting things"
aoXJfuPaFF8,ready, and it's awesome.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,487.987,"I get to go out with them later"
aoXJfuPaFF8,489.188,"and do some of their drills"
aoXJfuPaFF8,with Shepherd and Lebeouf.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,491.908," That's Justin"
aoXJfuPaFF8,who taught me how to whistle.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,493.559,"They took the RBM several miles"
aoXJfuPaFF8,off the coast out into the deep,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,496.929,"water to do some training,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and this is where I started,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,499.415,"to understand that nuclear sign"
aoXJfuPaFF8,we saw on the SAR OPS software.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,502.835,"Justin  -  All right, let's do a victor Sierra."
aoXJfuPaFF8,505.788,"Destin  -  Do a what?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,506.639,"So it's a search pattern."
aoXJfuPaFF8,508.241,"It's a it's a drifting search pattern."
aoXJfuPaFF8,510.426,"So we use this if, say we"
aoXJfuPaFF8,513.396,"someone says we get a radio call"
aoXJfuPaFF8,516.516,"and Coast Guard, I'm in this position"
aoXJfuPaFF8,of the person in the water,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,519.902,"and we fly out there and we get on scene"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and we don't see anybody.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,523.272,"We're going to do what's called a sector"
aoXJfuPaFF8,search or a Victor Sierra search pattern.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,527.91,"And you know,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,you'll see more of what we run through,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,530.68,"but basically that drifts"
aoXJfuPaFF8,with the current.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,534.033,"You and draw it."
aoXJfuPaFF8,535.201,"Yeah."
aoXJfuPaFF8,535.451,"So I'll I'll show you what a Victor"
aoXJfuPaFF8,Sierra looks like on paper.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,538.921,"And then we get down."
aoXJfuPaFF8,539.639,"I'll show you what it actually looks like,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,540.99,"taking into consideration"
aoXJfuPaFF8,the the current and the drift,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,543.295,"Shepard  -  want me to take the sticks? ( meaning control of the boat )"
aoXJfuPaFF8,545.494,"Justin  -  Yeah, go ahead."
aoXJfuPaFF8,546.729,"So you're taking control, taking control."
aoXJfuPaFF8,548.831,"Justin  -  So if this is the starting position,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,Victor Sierra is going to be like this,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,553.753,"and we'll end right here."
aoXJfuPaFF8,555.538,"Destin  -  That's a victor Sierra."
aoXJfuPaFF8,556.589,"Justin  -  Thats a victor sierra search pattern."
aoXJfuPaFF8,557.857,"So we'll start this way"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and then it just goes all the way around.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,562.712,"On paper, it looks like"
aoXJfuPaFF8,we're going to end up in the same spot,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,565.264,"but you'll see on the chart plotter"
aoXJfuPaFF8,here in a minute,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,567.366,"it's not going to look anything like this"
aoXJfuPaFF8,when we get done.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,569.919,"Well, try."
aoXJfuPaFF8,570.453,"Destin  -  How do you"
aoXJfuPaFF8,how do you command the boat to do that?,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,572.738,"Are you saying I'm going to run for"
aoXJfuPaFF8,a certain amount of time and a certain?,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,575.791,"Justin  -  Yeah, so we go a certain"
aoXJfuPaFF8,speed for a certain amount of time.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,578.311,"So we'll run six knots for one minute."
aoXJfuPaFF8,580.78,"Destin  -  And it will take you how far?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,582.582,"21 miles."
aoXJfuPaFF8,583.416,"Destin  -  OK. Got it."
aoXJfuPaFF8,584.216,"Justin  -  When I start, I'll set a waypoint and now"
aoXJfuPaFF8,there's a waypoint on our position.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,589.704,"Destin  -  uh Huh"
aoXJfuPaFF8,590.906,"So it's the"
aoXJfuPaFF8,other way and it's a waypoint on position.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,594.243,"When I finish, I'll set another waypoint"
aoXJfuPaFF8,596.729,"and I'll use the distance"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and the direction.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,599.665,"to determine set and drift and we'll use that"
aoXJfuPaFF8,to plug into our precision search pattern.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,604.77,"So you get a good search area,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,607.023,"figure out the most probable location"
aoXJfuPaFF8,for that search object.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,610.81,"Destin  -  So how long does it Victor Sierra take?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,613.562,"About nine minutes."
aoXJfuPaFF8,614.843,"Destin  -  Ok!"
aoXJfuPaFF8,615.576,"Justin  -  you have nine legs a minute apiece."
aoXJfuPaFF8,617.917,"The current and the winds can affect that,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,maybe not a half minutes.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,621.971,"And then it's like eight and a half."
aoXJfuPaFF8,623.489,"But we're going to try and turn for"
aoXJfuPaFF8,six knots once we get our speed set.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,626.192,"We'll leave it. We won't change our speed."
aoXJfuPaFF8,628.027,"We'll just let the current take us."
aoXJfuPaFF8,629.612,"So this is a search pattern, will."
aoXJfuPaFF8,632.882,"And so it's a nomograph."
aoXJfuPaFF8,634.717,"And basically, we'll tell you what courses"
aoXJfuPaFF8,you need to steer.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,637.72,"So we're going to start out at 200 degrees"
aoXJfuPaFF8,641.407,"and that I know"
aoXJfuPaFF8,my next course is going to be 330.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,644.527,"Destin  -  So where are we?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,645.177,"Destin  -  So we're in the center right now,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,right? Right.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,647.163,"Destin  -  Where is the first one."
aoXJfuPaFF8,648.514,"Justin  -  Leg one right here?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,649.598,"Destin  -  Why did you choose that course?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,651.55,"Justin  -  So looking at the elements coming"
aoXJfuPaFF8,this way, the wind coming from the north?,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,656.672,"Um, just estimating that's"
aoXJfuPaFF8,what I estimate said,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,659.342,"drift is going to be when we come on"
aoXJfuPaFF8,scene, we'll just estimate.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,662.611,"And then when we finish,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,we'll get the actual set and drift.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,665.531,"But you always want to try"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and go with the elements.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,667.8,"Destin  -  So you're trying to maximize the area you cover"
aoXJfuPaFF8,by also taking into account drifts.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,672.455,"Trying to cover a specific area because"
aoXJfuPaFF8,we know they're in that specific area.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,675.891,"Destin  -  Got it."
aoXJfuPaFF8,676.258,"OK, this is the nomograph"
aoXJfuPaFF8,677.96,"that Justin is using for the Victor"
aoXJfuPaFF8,Sierra and I love Nomographs.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,681.147,"It's a mechanical way to calculate things"
aoXJfuPaFF8,quickly, so let's check this out.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,685.368,"So if you look at what he was doing,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,you get this little spinning,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,688.554,"wheel here and it has a bunch of arrows"
aoXJfuPaFF8,pointing in different directions.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,692.041,"And you'll notice that the compass heading"
aoXJfuPaFF8,when we were in the,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,695.127,"in the boat there start at 200,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,which is pointing in this direction.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,698.447,"So what this does is this"
aoXJfuPaFF8,tells the boat crew what compass heading,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,702.685,"they should do the first leg on."
aoXJfuPaFF8,704.153,"After that,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,705.137,"they're going to do this"
aoXJfuPaFF8,other heading over here,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,707.206,"which is parallel to this, and you can"
aoXJfuPaFF8,just simply look at the nomograph.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,710.91,"Boom,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,we're going to go 3:20 on that next one.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,713.813,"So you can basically go through"
aoXJfuPaFF8,all of these and you can use the angles,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,717.633,"associated with whichever"
aoXJfuPaFF8,equilateral triangle you're dealing with.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,721.036,"And then that's a quick way"
aoXJfuPaFF8,to calculate your compass heading.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,723.956,"I think these things are awesome,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,725.391,"and it's clear there's other kind of cheat"
aoXJfuPaFF8,sheets here time and scale speed stuff.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,729.178,"This is what Justin is using to calculate"
aoXJfuPaFF8,the compass headings for the Victor Sierra,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,733.818,"OK. So when I go to the bow"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and point at them?,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,736.502,"Ortiz  - Got it."
aoXJfuPaFF8,737.369,"Destin  -  That's the datum.  Ortiz  -  Yes, you can see it."
aoXJfuPaFF8,741.841,"That's how"
aoXJfuPaFF8,it's going up, so we can see it at night.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,744.326,"OK, this is so cool."
aoXJfuPaFF8,745.561,"I had to like use"
aoXJfuPaFF8,this as an excuse to get one.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,747.863,"I know the word datum"
aoXJfuPaFF8,from mechanical engineering,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,749.965,"to mean a place"
aoXJfuPaFF8,from which you can measure other things.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,754.019,"Now, usually a datum is stationary,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,but this is a floating datum.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,758.491,"And I think that's really cool because"
aoXJfuPaFF8,760.075,"if one side's heavier than the other,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,you can make the orientation,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,763.729,"operate"
aoXJfuPaFF8,this little switch in here and light up,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,765.631,"that thing isn't that awesome anyway."
aoXJfuPaFF8,767.133,"So I think this is fascinating"
aoXJfuPaFF8,because you don't,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,770.186,"usually use the word datum"
aoXJfuPaFF8,for a moving thing.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,774.106,"So the question is,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,how are they going to use a moving datum?,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,778.21,"By the way,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,this is not a satellite tracking device.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,780.262,"It's literally just a floating light"
aoXJfuPaFF8,that blinks.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,782.748,"Shepard  -  If we arrive on scene."
aoXJfuPaFF8,784.667,"Possible P.I.W. situation."
aoXJfuPaFF8,786.869,"first thing we're going to do is deploy the datum, to get the most calculated set and drift"
aoXJfuPaFF8,792.758,"Datum deployed."
aoXJfuPaFF8,794.426,"So he's going to back off of it,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,so we're not affecting it.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,797.63,"And then"
aoXJfuPaFF8,799.696,"Shepard  -  we're going to back off"
aoXJfuPaFF8,far enough to where I can pass it going six knots,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,804.27,"So once I pass it, going six knots I'm going"
aoXJfuPaFF8,hands off the throttle,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,807.573,"so we can maintain that same"
aoXJfuPaFF8,engine speed the whole time.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,811.911,"All right. Ortiz"
aoXJfuPaFF8,812.444,"You're going to have port look out"
aoXJfuPaFF8,when it's off to starboard lookout.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,815.314,"Keep your eyes forward"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and I'll be all around lookout,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,818.317,"Justin  -  were going to come up to six knots,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,about eleven hundred rpms,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,821.921,"Shepard  -  Roger"
aoXJfuPaFF8,822.963,"Justin  -  I'm going to pass datum on your starboard side."
aoXJfuPaFF8,825.875,"Your first course is going to be 200."
aoXJfuPaFF8,828.777,"Shepard  -  200 aye"
aoXJfuPaFF8,831.063,"Shepard  -  Eleven hundred r.p.m.."
aoXJfuPaFF8,834.366,"Shepard  -  just past 6 knots going to come down to 950 rpms."
aoXJfuPaFF8,840.356,"So as soon as he passes it, I'm going to drop a waypoint"
aoXJfuPaFF8,843.158,"and we're going to use that to determine"
aoXJfuPaFF8,set and drift.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,845.911,"when we are done"
aoXJfuPaFF8,846.679,"Shepard  -  Approaching datum I'm going about seven knots"
aoXJfuPaFF8,848.163,"im going to drop it down. just a little bit more"
aoXJfuPaFF8,851.083,"Shepard  -  Datum out the The right window now"
aoXJfuPaFF8,855.521,"steering course 200."
aoXJfuPaFF8,857.189,"Justin  -  200 aye Next course is going to be 320"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and 50 seconds.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,861.176,"Shepard  -  320 aye"
aoXJfuPaFF8,862.528,"Destin  -  This is fascinating"
aoXJfuPaFF8,because there are so many different,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,864.78,"concepts happening here all at once."
aoXJfuPaFF8,866.615,"They're following a pattern"
aoXJfuPaFF8,that essentially breaks up a circle.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,869.351,"They're searching into equal pie pieces,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,which gives them the most efficient way,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,872.771,"of searching that circle"
aoXJfuPaFF8,for the PIW person in the water.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,876.008,"So there's two sides of the boat,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,the port and starboard.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,878.344,"I remember Port is on the left"
aoXJfuPaFF8,because Port has four letters,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,881.463,"and left has four letters."
aoXJfuPaFF8,882.781,"So with Ortiz looking out the port side"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and Muchachi,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,885.417,"looking out the starboard side"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and shepherd looking out the front.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,887.97,"They're able to cover every point"
aoXJfuPaFF8,in the pie in a very methodical way.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,891.49,"Now this would be pretty simple"
aoXJfuPaFF8,892.658,"if they were on land"
aoXJfuPaFF8,because the land doesn't float,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,894.927,"in one direction"
aoXJfuPaFF8,or another at varying speeds.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,897.246,"The center of the circle"
aoXJfuPaFF8,would stay in the same position,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,899.798,"in terms of where they are"
aoXJfuPaFF8,on the surface of the Earth,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,901.75,"which means the GPS location of that circle"
aoXJfuPaFF8,would stay consistent.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,905.07,"But on the ocean with the current,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,906.939,"the circle will need to move"
aoXJfuPaFF8,with the current in order to be relevant.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,910.509,"And that's why they drop the datum"
aoXJfuPaFF8,in the water to give them a way,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,913.379,"to keep the middle of the search in line"
aoXJfuPaFF8,with the drift to the water.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,916.799,"And they use math to make sure"
aoXJfuPaFF8,that they're still cutting the moving,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,919.602,"Pie pieces up equally"
aoXJfuPaFF8,as they search,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,923.289,"To minimize cross drift. They set up the first leg of their search"
aoXJfuPaFF8,in the direction,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,925.624,"that the currents flowing as best"
aoXJfuPaFF8,they can tell.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,927.81,"Shepard  -  So at this point, we will be going over"
aoXJfuPaFF8,what our search object is.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,931.063,"We're looking for a 40"
aoXJfuPaFF8,whatever year old male blue shirt.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,938.887,"Destin  - Oh, I see!"
aoXJfuPaFF8,940.205,"I see. I'm 39. Thank you."
aoXJfuPaFF8,943.242,"I wasn't describing you at first,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,but then I just picked Blue Shirt.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,946.078,"Justin  -  20 Seconds 320."
aoXJfuPaFF8,947.646,"Justin  -  Come to starboard."
aoXJfuPaFF8,948.297,"Shepard  -  so hard to right"
aoXJfuPaFF8,953.135,"Shepard  -  coming to 320"
aoXJfuPaFF8,956.188,"Destin  -  Are you looking at Shepard  -  looking at this"
aoXJfuPaFF8,959.224,"Shepard  -  need to look at it.  Destin  -  I'm sorry."
aoXJfuPaFF8,962.344,"Justin  -  All right. 320"
aoXJfuPaFF8,965.731,"Destin  -  Alright im going to come look. Shepard  -  alright you are good."
aoXJfuPaFF8,967.232,"Destin  -  So you're going to hold that."
aoXJfuPaFF8,973.122,"Justin  -  Do you see datum, off the starboard beam."
aoXJfuPaFF8,974.907,"Justin  -  I do straight off the starboard beam"
aoXJfuPaFF8,976.809,"I kind of thought turned out."
aoXJfuPaFF8,978.46,"Justin  -  come to starboard datum"
aoXJfuPaFF8,981.997,"Destin  -  I do not see it."
aoXJfuPaFF8,983.799,"Shepard  -  So directly off the bow."
aoXJfuPaFF8,985.934,"100 yards."
aoXJfuPaFF8,988.053,"Destin  -  Oh wow."
aoXJfuPaFF8,990.689,"Destin  -  That's hard to see in the sun glare. That's hard to see."
aoXJfuPaFF8,992.041," OK,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,this is something I didn't think about.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,994.243,"If you think about the challenge of trying"
aoXJfuPaFF8,995.828,"to find a human at about a 10th of a mile."
aoXJfuPaFF8,998.23,"It doesn't seem that difficult, right?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1000.866,"The thing"
aoXJfuPaFF8,is, you're not looking for an entire human,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1003.152,"body, you're only looking for the part"
aoXJfuPaFF8,of the human that's up above the water.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1007.039,"And if you can think about"
aoXJfuPaFF8,how the Coast Guard works, you might have,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1010.426,"a human head"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and a life ring like this, right?,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1013.645,"So a human head at about arm's"
aoXJfuPaFF8,length in front of you is about.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1018.35,"A foot or so, right?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,That seems reasonable.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1021.203,"But if you do the math real quick,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,that same human head at a 10th of a mile,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1025.29,"or 528 feet"
aoXJfuPaFF8,is more like 47 thousands of an inch.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1029.728,"If I do this right"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and I got a 10th of a mile away.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1032.181,"That should be about as big as my head is."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1034.183,"It is very difficult"
aoXJfuPaFF8,to see something out in the water.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1037.069,"I couldn't do it at all"
aoXJfuPaFF8,the coasties were great at it.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1039.438,"Another thing to think about"
aoXJfuPaFF8,if there's water,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1041.123,"going up and down in between me and you,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1042.925,"if it's a consistent wave, it's"
aoXJfuPaFF8,going to cover the object half the time.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1047.062,"My point is it's very difficult to see"
aoXJfuPaFF8,things out in the water with your eyes.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1051.75,"Destin  -  So are you following a course ?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1055.187,"Shepard  -  no course I'm aiming at datum?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1056.422,"Justin  -  So once you pass datum,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,you're going to come to 080.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1059.007,"OK, I don't know if you heard"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1059.958,"what Justin just said, but it is critical"
aoXJfuPaFF8,to making a victor Sierra work, he said.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1063.896,"They go out on a compass heading."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1065.431,"They turn on a compass heading"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1066.782,"and then they head back towards the datum,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,not on a compass heading.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1069.902,"So basically, they put this thing"
aoXJfuPaFF8,over the nose of the boat,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1073.522,"and they're going straight at datum"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and as soon as they pass datum,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1076.708,"then they pick up their compass heading."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1078.377,"This is critical"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1079.611,"to making sure that the Victor"
aoXJfuPaFF8,Sierra moves with the drifting water.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1083.298,"Also, I feel like I need to confess here"
aoXJfuPaFF8,I wanted to get a really sweet view,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1086.819,"from the top of the boat"
aoXJfuPaFF8,by clamping a GoPro up there.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1089.521,"But sometimes I'm an idiot."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1091.039,"I went up there to try to like,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,turn the GoPro on, but I was out of phase,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1094.376,"and I turn the GoPro off"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and I feel shame and I'm sorry.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1098.53,"All right."
aoXJfuPaFF8,So once we finished the Victor Sierra,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1100.649,"what we're going to do"
aoXJfuPaFF8,is we're going to measure the distance,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1102.534,"between the waypoint"
aoXJfuPaFF8,we dropped when we started,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1104.486,"and the waypoint we dropped"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and we finished as well as get the course.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1108.39,"So I've got"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1109.558,"153 degrees magnetic at 50 feet."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1116.081,"So over the course of nine minutes,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1118.917,"we drifted 50 feet."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1120.602,"So now we just do the math"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1123.088,"to see how far we drift in an hour"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and that's going to be our drift.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1127.326,"And the set is going to be 153 degrees"
aoXJfuPaFF8,magnetic 50,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1130.562,"feet over nine minutes, hardly"
aoXJfuPaFF8,any sudden shift at all.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1134.233,"It's going to be like point .02 knots"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1136.118,"Destin  -  So calm seas?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1137.369,"Yeah, it's very calm out"
aoXJfuPaFF8,here. We're  not drifting very much.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1140.322,"As you can see on the chart,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,the Victor Sierra is almost perfect.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1144.51,"So, you know, and heavier weather,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,you know that Victor,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1147.129,"Sierra is going to look like this."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1148.714,"It's going to come."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1152.1,"You know, it may look something like that."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1153.769,"Destin  -  Oh, OK."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1154.536,"Shepard  -  Yes, it's one of the most perfect victor sierras"
aoXJfuPaFF8,completed. victor sierras ive ever seen,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1157.523,"Destin  -  really?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1158.595,"Shepard  -  one of the calmest days  I've seen out here."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1161.844,"OK, check this out."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1162.778,"Let's simulate"
aoXJfuPaFF8,the GPS coordinates of an RBM,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1166.131,"performing a victor Sierra"
aoXJfuPaFF8,in different types of sea drift.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1169.902,"Man, that was a sentence, wasn't it?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1171.236,"The higher the drift rate, the more crazy"
aoXJfuPaFF8,the pattern looks.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1174.957,"But if you think about it,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,that's actually the right thing to do,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1178.26,"because they're actually cutting the pie"
aoXJfuPaFF8,up with that drifting section of water.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1183.498,"And furthermore,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,they're getting data that they can,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1186.451,"then feed back into the sector command"
aoXJfuPaFF8,so that they can input that data,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1190.756,"into the SAR OPS software"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1192.407,"so they have the best chance"
aoXJfuPaFF8,of releasing other assets,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1195.594,"that might need to come on scene"
aoXJfuPaFF8,to help with the search and rescue.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1199.081,"This is fascinating."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1200.182,"If you were to draw this and say,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,Hey, this is what we're going to do,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1203.302,"when we get the scene"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and this is the best way to find you,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1206.371,"that is not what I would think"
aoXJfuPaFF8,the visualization would look like.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1209.908,"But this is an awesome way"
aoXJfuPaFF8,of doing things.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1212.277,"I think that Victor Sierra"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1213.478,"is incredibly clever,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,but it is applied in certain situations.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1217.583,"There are other types of search patterns"
aoXJfuPaFF8,in other situations,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1220.969,"and to learn more about those,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,let's go back up to Station Rochester,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1224.239,"and ask the coasties"
aoXJfuPaFF8,what's up with that?,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1226.225,"OK, so what are the other kinds"
aoXJfuPaFF8,of search patterns?,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1228.56,"Because there's other ones, right?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1230.095,"Whatcha got"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1231.23,"So you have an expanding square,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1233.298,"which is another form of a drifting"
aoXJfuPaFF8,search pattern,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1236.184,"kind of like the same thing"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1237.202,"and more for a concert area, but"
aoXJfuPaFF8,you're slowly building a bigger square.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1240.989,"Destin  -  So is it like playing the game snake?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1243.041,"Yeah, you're making 90 degree turns"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and you're going one minute,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1246.595,"and then you're making a 90 degree turn,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,going one minute, making 90 degree,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1249.414,"turn around two minutes later,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,you know, green turn down two minutes,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1253.285,"and then three minutes and so on,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and you're just building a square,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1256.071,"that's bigger and bigger."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1257.456,"Destin  -  OK, so what else we have?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1259.608,"We have any other kinds?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1260.993,"You have parallel search"
aoXJfuPaFF8,patterns, you have creep search patterns.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1265.163,"So if you had a rectangle"
aoXJfuPaFF8,shaped search area,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1267.933,"where you'd deem"
aoXJfuPaFF8,this was the area we're going to search.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1269.851,"If you were to do a parallel,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,you would search long ways.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1272.01,"Destin  -  ok"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1272.871,"Miller  -  And if you were going to do a creep ,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,you would search short ways.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1275.907,"Destin  -  Oh, OK, so it's your coloring the square."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1278.76,"Weston -  Yeah, we have like a barrier search,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1280.679,"and that would be like for a river"
aoXJfuPaFF8,example, like station Niagara.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1283.532,"There's a lot of barrier searches."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1284.866,"Weston  -  OK, so they'll sit in one spot"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and basically go back and forth,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1288.003,"to catch anything"
aoXJfuPaFF8,that's coming down the river.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1289.972,"So there's search, there's search units"
aoXJfuPaFF8,further up there just making sure,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1293.792,"if anything gets past them,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,they can catch it coming down the river.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1296.211,"And then there's a track line patterns."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1298.914,"So if we know"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1300.032,"vessel left in a certain direction"
aoXJfuPaFF8,like that, an overdue vessel,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1302.451,"they knew"
aoXJfuPaFF8,they were in a certain direction.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1303.769,"We can follow that track line"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1305.337,"and search for them along that line."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1307.072,"Or people go from Florida to Bimini, whatever they know at the track line, just go,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1312.11,"Destin  -  huh. OK."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1313.161,"And then shoreline search would just be"
aoXJfuPaFF8,we get as close to shore as we can go,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1316.581,"and we're looking for something"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1317.966,"to be on the water"
aoXJfuPaFF8,or a vessel or something like that.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1320.452,"It's just kind of a quick and dirty search"
aoXJfuPaFF8,for us.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1322.554,"Victor Sierra expanding square parallels"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1327.392,"creep than we have."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1329.878,"What was the one where you go back barrier"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1332.848,"and then you have the shoreline"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1335.183,"and then the last one is a track line, right?"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1337.886,"Destin  -  Wow, that's awesome."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1339.955,"That's cool, though."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1340.922,"Is it fun? Yeah,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,it can be tricky sometimes.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1344.242,"Sometimes it sucks."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1345.377,"Yeah, there are like eight footers"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and you're taking them beam too,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1348.08,"because that's just how the search pattern"
aoXJfuPaFF8,is like if they're drifting that way.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1351.299,"And that's how they."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1352.517,"And this is the most probable area"
aoXJfuPaFF8,1353.869,"that's going to be that doesn't"
aoXJfuPaFF8,mean it's working with the elements.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1355.821,"So you might be going"
aoXJfuPaFF8,two miles in one direction,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1358.557,"and the waves are just hitting"
aoXJfuPaFF8,you beam too.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1360.392,"And that's just how it is."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1361.376,"There's nothing you can do about it,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,but that's the most probable area,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1363.562,"where they're going to be,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and that's what you have to do.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1364.996,"Destin  -  Oh, oh, wow."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1366.348,"So the search patterns"
aoXJfuPaFF8,calculated at sector,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1370.369,"are often independent of what"
aoXJfuPaFF8,the water is actually doing.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1374.523,"So try to work with as best they can,"
aoXJfuPaFF8,but in some situations,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1377.692,"that there's no this can't fix."
aoXJfuPaFF8,Destin  -  So what do you do?,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1379.945,"You say, Hey, sector, I'm taking big waves"
aoXJfuPaFF8,over here from my left.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1384.082,"You can tell them that"
aoXJfuPaFF8,and they'll be like, OK, like,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1385.851,"I might be have a different way."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1386.902,"They can do it, and then they'll they'll"
aoXJfuPaFF8,try to change it for you if they can.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1389.821,"But if they can't, that's what you just"
aoXJfuPaFF8,got to work with. It's just what it is.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1394.609,"It's interesting that the"
aoXJfuPaFF8,situation on the ground or in the water,,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1398.28,"so to speak, is often different"
aoXJfuPaFF8,than what it looks like at sector.,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1402.467,"Yeah."
aoXJfuPaFF8,What was that smile? No. What was it?,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1405.203,"I saw the smile."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1406.238,"It's just too different is that it's"
aoXJfuPaFF8,the true, isn't it different worlds?,""
aoXJfuPaFF8,1409.891,"That's all it is. But you know."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1411.293,"The biggest thing."
aoXJfuPaFF8,1412.01,"Is it's pretty fluid as a team"

AVNcWerm1-M,1.899,"hi I'm Stephan caste and today Jennifer"
AVNcWerm1-M,4.79,"wine is going to take us through some"
AVNcWerm1-M,6.74,"basic strategies of sweeping larger"
AVNcWerm1-M,9.29,"opponents from the guard so take it away"
AVNcWerm1-M,11.66,"Jennifer so being a smaller person you"
AVNcWerm1-M,14.0,"usually find that you end up on the"
AVNcWerm1-M,15.559,"bottom and obviously there's a lot of"
AVNcWerm1-M,17.63,"different attacks that you can do from a"
AVNcWerm1-M,19.1,"closed guard but say for example he's"
AVNcWerm1-M,21.26,"about to open your guard a concept that"
AVNcWerm1-M,23.6,"has really helped evolve my game is keep"
AVNcWerm1-M,26.18,"in mind opening it on my terms so I'm"
AVNcWerm1-M,28.34,"not in a bad position so for example"
AVNcWerm1-M,30.619,"he's about to pass my close guard and"
AVNcWerm1-M,33.01,"this is where rather than letting myself"
AVNcWerm1-M,35.69,"get in a bad position he takes across"
AVNcWerm1-M,37.61,"I'd control is I'll open it on my terms"
AVNcWerm1-M,40.67,"from here I like to play spider guided"
AVNcWerm1-M,43.01,"so one quick and easy sweep that you can"
AVNcWerm1-M,45.17,"do right away is putting a lot of"
AVNcWerm1-M,46.61,"pressure on his left bicep pulling down"
AVNcWerm1-M,48.98,"or his right bicep pulling down on his"
AVNcWerm1-M,51.29,"arm"
AVNcWerm1-M,51.68,"setting him off-balance a key concept is"
AVNcWerm1-M,55.309,"that you need to pull this arm tightly"
AVNcWerm1-M,57.17,"across if I want to pull it and then try"
AVNcWerm1-M,59.42,"the sweet pips"
AVNcWerm1-M,60.17,"you can post his hand out so we need to"
AVNcWerm1-M,62.539,"pull the arm tightly across and then"
AVNcWerm1-M,64.879,"taking my right foot and pushing on his"
AVNcWerm1-M,66.77,"knee and coming up into them so a lot of"
AVNcWerm1-M,71.149,"times when you're attempting that"
AVNcWerm1-M,72.319,"previous sweep he's going to post this"
AVNcWerm1-M,74.749,"foot up and then stand up to try to pass"
AVNcWerm1-M,77.24,"my guard I already have this foot on his"
AVNcWerm1-M,80.84,"right side"
AVNcWerm1-M,81.77,"so all I'll do is keep control of his"
AVNcWerm1-M,84.529,"sleeves transfer this to his hip I can"
AVNcWerm1-M,88.759,"use this to create mobility to swing me"
AVNcWerm1-M,91.759,"over let go grab the back of his ankle"
AVNcWerm1-M,94.639,"and this one kicks me off and you use"
AVNcWerm1-M,97.849,"the momentum to help lift you up so just"
AVNcWerm1-M,100.159,"showing that sweep again I'm attempting"
AVNcWerm1-M,102.679,"to go through this suite but he stands"
AVNcWerm1-M,104.45,"up so I tried to my foot to his hip"
AVNcWerm1-M,107.109,"grabbed the back of his ankle kick out"
AVNcWerm1-M,111.24,"wantin to come up i keep control of this"
AVNcWerm1-M,113.399,"and right away the path is that so the"
AVNcWerm1-M,119.82,"reason that I'm controlling is ankle"
AVNcWerm1-M,121.47,"after I do the sweep is to prevent him"
AVNcWerm1-M,123.81,"from closing me in half guard or from"
AVNcWerm1-M,126.0,"shrimping out and doing the technical"

bErptxD1jho,278.88,"you know you had a recent car accident"
bErptxD1jho,280.72,"and you can't move your whole body if"

bErptxD1jho,283.44,"physically move"
bErptxD1jho,284.4,"for any other reason you need to"
bErptxD1jho,286.08,"actually do this seminar with us"
bErptxD1jho,287.68,"otherwise"
bErptxD1jho,288.08,"and you don't you're wasting everyone"
bErptxD1jho,289.199,"you don't need a mat all you need is a"
bErptxD1jho,290.639,"little bit of space boom maybe a soft"
bErptxD1jho,292.32,"surface would be nice"
bErptxD1jho,293.28,"carpet carpet carpet a rug just a little"
bErptxD1jho,296.32,"bit of area to get down on the floor"
bErptxD1jho,298.24,"but we have students we have students on"
bErptxD1jho,299.6,"zoom who've been doing it on hardwood"
bErptxD1jho,300.8,"floor for the last four months and i'm"
bErptxD1jho,302.08,"like what are you doing bro"
bErptxD1jho,303.199,"invest in a smallest little mat and he's"
bErptxD1jho,304.639,"like not straight if i'm gonna fight in"
bErptxD1jho,306.08,"a street fight"
bErptxD1jho,306.72,"i gotta know what it feels like i'm like"
bErptxD1jho,308.08,"dude you're so genius"
bErptxD1jho,309.759,"don't take that as advice i'm just"
bErptxD1jho,311.039,"saying it's happening you guys that's"
bErptxD1jho,312.479,"right um so we're gonna do it we're"
bErptxD1jho,313.759,"gonna expect you guys to actually"
bErptxD1jho,314.639,"practice and you're gonna have a chance"
bErptxD1jho,315.6,"to ask"
bErptxD1jho,316.0,"questions so we're gonna start with a"
bErptxD1jho,317.36,"warm up jiu jitsu warm up where we're"
bErptxD1jho,318.96,"gonna do some movements that won't even"
bErptxD1jho,320.479,"make sense why we're doing them"
bErptxD1jho,321.919,"and then once we do the techniques"
bErptxD1jho,323.199,"you're gonna go oh my gosh the warm-ups"
bErptxD1jho,325.36,"played into the actual moves that we are"
bErptxD1jho,328.0,"now doing okay so jiu-jitsu warm-ups for"
bErptxD1jho,330.16,"today's jiu-jitsu techniques"
bErptxD1jho,331.84,"after the warm-ups we're gonna see our"
bErptxD1jho,333.12,"techniques we have about six techniques"
bErptxD1jho,334.88,"slated"
bErptxD1jho,335.44,"it's gonna be adjusted based on a time"
bErptxD1jho,337.039,"and how the clock runs but i think we"
bErptxD1jho,338.72,"have enough time to have a lot of fun"
bErptxD1jho,340.08,"you guys can actually learn jiu jitsu"
bErptxD1jho,341.44,"and actually learn something and that's"
bErptxD1jho,342.639,"right and i think it's important to set"
bErptxD1jho,344.08,"up some expectations for what you guys"
bErptxD1jho,345.919,"are going to be doing and learning today"
bErptxD1jho,347.84,"and what we don't recommend is that"
bErptxD1jho,350.08,"after the seminar you go out and like"
bErptxD1jho,351.52,"pick a fight"
bErptxD1jho,352.0,"and try to test it out okay we don't"
bErptxD1jho,353.36,"recommend that yes okay"
bErptxD1jho,356.16,"so what will we learn today the idea"
bErptxD1jho,358.319,"today is that"
bErptxD1jho,360.0,"specifically from that uh that that"
bErptxD1jho,363.36,"assault"
bErptxD1jho,364.08,"we talked about a principle and that"
bErptxD1jho,366.24,"principle was"
bErptxD1jho,367.199,"distance management and we are going to"
bErptxD1jho,369.52,"focus so heavily on that principle"
bErptxD1jho,371.36,"because our belief is that"
bErptxD1jho,372.96,"even at least at the end of this seminar"
bErptxD1jho,375.039,"if you can"
bErptxD1jho,376.479,"understand and actually embody some of"
bErptxD1jho,379.52,"that principle with the techniques that"
bErptxD1jho,381.36,"we are learning"
bErptxD1jho,382.479,"your chance of survivability and a fight"
bErptxD1jho,385.36,"or an altercation goes way up"
bErptxD1jho,387.199,"so even if we can just understand that"
bErptxD1jho,388.96,"concept and it's a simple one"
bErptxD1jho,390.56,"but seeing it's under easy to understand"
bErptxD1jho,392.8,"hard to apply because it's very"
bErptxD1jho,394.16,"counterintuitive which is what we're"
bErptxD1jho,395.52,"going to see"
bErptxD1jho,396.0,"so we're going to dive so heavy into"
bErptxD1jho,397.44,"that the goal is for you guys to leave"
bErptxD1jho,398.88,"today"
bErptxD1jho,399.6,"feeling like i understand this principle"
bErptxD1jho,402.0,"i understand"
bErptxD1jho,402.8,"how a smaller person could defend"
bErptxD1jho,404.8,"themselves against a larger person"
bErptxD1jho,406.56,"if they simply understand how to employ"
bErptxD1jho,408.639,"these these principles love that and"
bErptxD1jho,410.16,"just to give you an idea of what's"
bErptxD1jho,411.199,"accomplishable here"
bErptxD1jho,412.08,"in an average year the average police"
bErptxD1jho,413.599,"officer gets four hours"
bErptxD1jho,415.199,"of jujitsu type training in the whole"
bErptxD1jho,417.44,"year"
bErptxD1jho,418.319,"today in the two hours we're together"
bErptxD1jho,420.479,"you're gonna get half of an american"
bErptxD1jho,422.4,"police officer's"
bErptxD1jho,423.599,"arsenal and you're not saying much which"
bErptxD1jho,425.68,"is not saying much it's saying more"
bErptxD1jho,427.039,"about what they're not getting"
bErptxD1jho,428.16,"but it's also saying listen if cops are"
bErptxD1jho,431.12,"trusted on four hours a year we can do"
bErptxD1jho,433.039,"some damage in two hours"
bErptxD1jho,434.8,"with the source of the information where"
bErptxD1jho,436.319,"the cops come to get the information"
bErptxD1jho,438.56,"is grace university and we're going"
bErptxD1jho,439.919,"direct to the end user which is you guys"

bErptxD1jho,1013.04,"already very"
bErptxD1jho,1014.16,"very disrespectful and violating of that"
bErptxD1jho,1015.92,"personal bubble and if"
bErptxD1jho,1017.199,"she faces me and stands up any old way"
bErptxD1jho,1019.519,"go ahead"
bErptxD1jho,1021.839,"it can become a serious attack can"
bErptxD1jho,1023.68,"evolve from this because"
bErptxD1jho,1025.199,"she's sitting down this person is"
bErptxD1jho,1026.4,"standing up i have an advantage of"
bErptxD1jho,1027.6,"gravity over her yeah many of you are"
bErptxD1jho,1029.039,"saying just stand up right which is a"
bErptxD1jho,1030.48,"great which is a great idea i would like"
bErptxD1jho,1031.839,"to get to my feet to be able to"
bErptxD1jho,1033.039,"get away but if i just stand up anyway"
bErptxD1jho,1034.959,"like henner said i can"
bErptxD1jho,1036.079,"just push me right back and here's why"
bErptxD1jho,1037.679,"parallel feet parallel"
bErptxD1jho,1039.839,"feet keep eve off balance okay"
bErptxD1jho,1043.039,"her feet being parallel look at the line"
bErptxD1jho,1045.52,"between her two feet and the line"
bErptxD1jho,1046.64,"between my two feet"
bErptxD1jho,1047.76,"they're parallel so as a result she's"
bErptxD1jho,1050.559,"tippable she's not going to get up"
bErptxD1jho,1052.48,"but if instead she does this watch this"
bErptxD1jho,1054.16,"she gets up with perpendicular bass"
bErptxD1jho,1056.799,"there's no way she's going to get pushed"
bErptxD1jho,1058.24,"back down on the get up and now she can"
bErptxD1jho,1060.0,"address the threat she can hit the"
bErptxD1jho,1061.28,"person"
bErptxD1jho,1061.84,"she can back up she can run all things"
bErptxD1jho,1064.08,"she couldn't do"
bErptxD1jho,1065.2,"if she was stuck on her hips on the"
bErptxD1jho,1066.72,"ground one more time to think about this"
bErptxD1jho,1068.16,"in the context of an altercation"
bErptxD1jho,1069.679,"it's very likely somebody might fall to"
bErptxD1jho,1071.44,"the ground so whether it's a situation"
bErptxD1jho,1072.88,"right"
bErptxD1jho,1073.52,"which pushes you down and she has to get"
bErptxD1jho,1075.28,"back up if you need to get back up and"
bErptxD1jho,1076.64,"your feet are here"
bErptxD1jho,1077.52,"it's very difficult to get back up to"
bErptxD1jho,1079.12,"your feet so we want to practice getting"
bErptxD1jho,1080.48,"back up to our feet"
bErptxD1jho,1081.44,"feet as quickly as possible why do you"
bErptxD1jho,1083.039,"teach us we do that with our base"
bErptxD1jho,1085.2,"so instead of having parallel feet you"
bErptxD1jho,1087.039,"guys can watch this one and then you"
bErptxD1jho,1088.559,"guys are going to join us on the"
bErptxD1jho,1090.0,"subsequent ones here so first just kind"
bErptxD1jho,1091.679,"of watch and observe"
bErptxD1jho,1093.28,"i'm going to cross my feet ankle to"
bErptxD1jho,1095.28,"ankle so this looks very casual right"
bErptxD1jho,1097.919,"my my one ankle is close to my hips the"
bErptxD1jho,1100.32,"other foot is right out in front here"
bErptxD1jho,1102.48,"my hand on the side of the flat leg"
bErptxD1jho,1106.0,"is down on the ground by my hips and"
bErptxD1jho,1107.919,"then i can just lift my hips off the"
bErptxD1jho,1109.6,"ground"
bErptxD1jho,1110.48,"and when i do that watch my foot lands"
bErptxD1jho,1112.48,"outside of my hand"
bErptxD1jho,1114.24,"but look at now my legs we call this"
bErptxD1jho,1116.48,"like the house"
bErptxD1jho,1117.44,"how strong this is how my knees are"
bErptxD1jho,1119.039,"facing out and it's very sturdy"
bErptxD1jho,1121.039,"and most importantly is that look at the"
bErptxD1jho,1123.039,"feet just yeah yeah so the most"
bErptxD1jho,1124.64,"important part about this"
bErptxD1jho,1126.16,"is that as henry mentioned if i do this"
bErptxD1jho,1128.4,"pair of"
bErptxD1jho,1129.2,"if my feet end up parallel to his i'm"
bErptxD1jho,1131.2,"going to be able to fall"
bErptxD1jho,1132.559,"so what i want is for my feet the angle"
bErptxD1jho,1135.44,"of my feet"
bErptxD1jho,1136.0,"to be perpendicular to henners okay and"
bErptxD1jho,1138.559,"i do that"
bErptxD1jho,1139.44,"here i want to make sure that my front"
bErptxD1jho,1140.799,"foot is facing him my hips come up and"
bErptxD1jho,1143.12,"my foot lands outside"
bErptxD1jho,1144.48,"and now we're here and now if they push"
bErptxD1jho,1146.16,"you're in base if they don't push"
bErptxD1jho,1147.84,"no problem i can get up and i can run"
bErptxD1jho,1150.0,"better to be ready"
bErptxD1jho,1151.2,"and not need it than to need it and not"
bErptxD1jho,1153.44,"be ready this is the case of all of"
bErptxD1jho,1155.2,"jiu-jitsu"

bErptxD1jho,1160.4,"so start from like your casual way of"
bErptxD1jho,1162.08,"saying what's up dude"
bErptxD1jho,1165.28,"doesn't matter just here wherever we"
bErptxD1jho,1167.44,"however we casually sit we want to get"
bErptxD1jho,1169.12,"to our"
bErptxD1jho,1170.0,"get up and base ready positions creepers"
bErptxD1jho,1171.679,"walking up we do this so let's start"
bErptxD1jho,1173.36,"with our right leg down everyone do the"
bErptxD1jho,1175.12,"same side so that we can kind of talk"
bErptxD1jho,1176.799,"you through this so everyone's right"
bErptxD1jho,1178.0,"leg is tucked left leg is posted right"
bErptxD1jho,1180.559,"in front here"
bErptxD1jho,1181.36,"run up one down guys let's go now your"
bErptxD1jho,1182.96,"right hand is going to be close to your"
bErptxD1jho,1184.4,"hip"
bErptxD1jho,1185.76,"very close to your hip and now we're"
bErptxD1jho,1187.6,"going to everyone just lift up your hips"
bErptxD1jho,1188.799,"right now don't even stand up just lift"
bErptxD1jho,1190.32,"your hips off the ground"
bErptxD1jho,1191.52,"by pushing off of our hand beautiful"
bErptxD1jho,1193.28,"nice good shiny great"
bErptxD1jho,1195.36,"so now from here hips go up and now"
bErptxD1jho,1197.76,"watch our foot"
bErptxD1jho,1198.72,"is going to land right outside of our"
bErptxD1jho,1200.32,"hand now don't lift"
bErptxD1jho,1202.24,"don't don't lift your hand off the"
bErptxD1jho,1203.6,"ground until what your foot lands"
bErptxD1jho,1205.6,"and now we're here strong and strong"
bErptxD1jho,1207.2,"base let's look at that one more time"
bErptxD1jho,1208.72,"everyone back down let's try it again"
bErptxD1jho,1210.48,"do it with those guys yeah so i want you"
bErptxD1jho,1212.24,"to look at this one of the most common"
bErptxD1jho,1213.679,"mistakes"
bErptxD1jho,1214.72,"is your hand goes out and the foot tries"
bErptxD1jho,1217.36,"to go inside"
bErptxD1jho,1218.32,"of the hand look right that is not a"
bErptxD1jho,1220.799,"house this is a very"
bErptxD1jho,1221.919,"well she'll just get pushed back down"
bErptxD1jho,1223.28,"very weak very very weak base"
bErptxD1jho,1225.919,"the strongest base is hand close to our"
bErptxD1jho,1227.679,"hip hips up foot lands right outside"
bErptxD1jho,1230.48,"and we're up and then we're up in base"
bErptxD1jho,1231.76,"and back down hands can go down and"
bErptxD1jho,1233.52,"here's the thing if you need two hands"
bErptxD1jho,1235.039,"down we can do that as well"
bErptxD1jho,1236.64,"so it could be that one hand is blocking"
bErptxD1jho,1238.159,"while the other one gets up or it could"
bErptxD1jho,1239.76,"be that we need both hands because it's"
bErptxD1jho,1241.28,"unstable terrain"
bErptxD1jho,1242.559,"everyone lift your hips your foot legs"
bErptxD1jho,1244.32,"outside boom and we're up"
bErptxD1jho,1246.0,"and now we can move around bring him in"
bErptxD1jho,1247.679,"excellent so that's the standard"
bErptxD1jho,1248.64,"variation now if the person's here sit"
bErptxD1jho,1250.24,"down"
bErptxD1jho,1250.799,"so the person's standing over you and"
bErptxD1jho,1252.08,"you feel a little too close it doesn't"
bErptxD1jho,1253.6,"feel safe to get up from this distance"
bErptxD1jho,1255.28,"there's also a ninja get up or a jump"
bErptxD1jho,1257.44,"back variation watch this"
bErptxD1jho,1259.12,"look how far she is so in the same exact"
bErptxD1jho,1261.36,"get up she was able to get with much"
bErptxD1jho,1262.559,"more distance one more time eve"
bErptxD1jho,1264.32,"so all she does is she folds and puts"
bErptxD1jho,1265.919,"her hands further back the same but my"
bErptxD1jho,1267.52,"hands end up further back and push"
bErptxD1jho,1269.2,"off both hands on the ground push off my"
bErptxD1jho,1271.44,"front leg"
bErptxD1jho,1272.24,"and watch as my legs look how far look"
bErptxD1jho,1274.32,"how i land though in base still"
bErptxD1jho,1276.4,"okay so everyone's sitting down"
bErptxD1jho,1277.36,"perpendicular still legs wide do it with"
bErptxD1jho,1279.2,"me you guys we're sitting down both"

bErptxD1jho,1346.799,"this is it you guys and this is how you"
bErptxD1jho,1348.24,"want to stand up only for the rest of"
bErptxD1jho,1349.6,"your lives as long as you do that you'll"
bErptxD1jho,1350.88,"never have an issue"
bErptxD1jho,1351.679,"getting to your feet during a potential"
bErptxD1jho,1353.039,"exercise and not just"
bErptxD1jho,1354.72,"yeah when when there's an altercation"
bErptxD1jho,1356.559,"but when you are watching tv"
bErptxD1jho,1358.32,"and you need to get up and get a glass"
bErptxD1jho,1360.08,"of water or you're sitting on the ground"
bErptxD1jho,1361.919,"and you're just"
bErptxD1jho,1362.72,"every single time this is it you guys"
bErptxD1jho,1364.559,"and hold each other accountable if"
bErptxD1jho,1365.84,"there's two people in the household"
bErptxD1jho,1367.2,"i give you permission whoever is"
bErptxD1jho,1368.96,"standing up if there's someone else gets"
bErptxD1jho,1370.48,"up wrong like"
bErptxD1jho,1371.039,"hey what's up imagine our household you"
bErptxD1jho,1373.28,"guys and there's little kids"
bErptxD1jho,1374.48,"the five-year-old he already knows how"
bErptxD1jho,1375.919,"to get up so if he doesn't get up right"
bErptxD1jho,1377.44,"he gets a little kick in the back like"
bErptxD1jho,1378.88,"boom falls down"
bErptxD1jho,1379.919,"just a great confidence builder as a"
bErptxD1jho,1381.36,"gracie child"
bErptxD1jho,1383.2,"because that was a little too much yeah"
bErptxD1jho,1385.2,"there is don't report me don't report me"
bErptxD1jho,1388.159,"there may or may not be a little bit of"
bErptxD1jho,1389.36,"that going on in our household but yeah"
bErptxD1jho,1390.799,"strong base"
bErptxD1jho,1391.44,"every time that we stand up every time"
bErptxD1jho,1392.88,"basically because here's the thing"
bErptxD1jho,1394.48,"what are the chances you get up in base"
bErptxD1jho,1396.08,"like this when your life is on the line"
bErptxD1jho,1398.72,"if you don't get up like in base like"
bErptxD1jho,1400.159,"this when your life isn't on the line"
bErptxD1jho,1402.08,"but if it doesn't become second nature"
bErptxD1jho,1404.0,"so this needs to become muscle memory as"
bErptxD1jho,1405.52,"do the rest of the techniques we're"
bErptxD1jho,1406.48,"going to see today"
bErptxD1jho,1407.2,"starting with the trap and roll even"
bErptxD1jho,1408.4,"down so imagine the altercation starts"
bErptxD1jho,1410.08,"standing up"
bErptxD1jho,1410.799,"scuffle scuffle scuffle someone throws"
bErptxD1jho,1412.799,"you to the ground right and what happens"
bErptxD1jho,1414.64,"is"
bErptxD1jho,1415.039,"once they land on the ground they can"
bErptxD1jho,1416.32,"end up in this position called the mount"
bErptxD1jho,1418.0,"this is very problematic you guys if"
bErptxD1jho,1419.84,"you've never done jiu jitsu"
bErptxD1jho,1421.679,"this is your worst nightmare if you land"
bErptxD1jho,1423.6,"in eve's position if you know shishuitsu"
bErptxD1jho,1425.6,"you smile from down here because you go"
bErptxD1jho,1427.12,"oh that's no big deal but if you're"
bErptxD1jho,1428.799,"new lowest common denominator newer"
bErptxD1jho,1430.88,"students of the art you've never"
bErptxD1jho,1431.919,"practiced"
bErptxD1jho,1432.559,"and you're on the fence of whether or"
bErptxD1jho,1433.6,"not you should ever do jujitsu for real"
bErptxD1jho,1435.2,"this is why you need to look at this"
bErptxD1jho,1437.44,"eek this is why it's so bad simple"
bErptxD1jho,1440.48,"it's no words needed to describe why"
bErptxD1jho,1442.64,"this is so dangerous for eve"
bErptxD1jho,1444.32,"look look and if she does hit me"
bErptxD1jho,1447.36,"i can absorb it if i hit she goes boom"
bErptxD1jho,1449.76,"into the pavement worst case scenario"
bErptxD1jho,1451.36,"today we're going to see two escapes"
bErptxD1jho,1452.559,"from the trap and roll from our gracie"
bErptxD1jho,1454.08,"combatives and women in power programs"
bErptxD1jho,1456.0,"starting with a standard variation and"
bErptxD1jho,1457.6,"then what happens if they do punches in"
bErptxD1jho,1459.12,"your face"
bErptxD1jho,1459.679,"we'll see that one right after the"
bErptxD1jho,1460.799,"standard variation first so if someone's"
bErptxD1jho,1462.159,"mounted on you yeah"
bErptxD1jho,1463.36,"standard variation this is very bad"
bErptxD1jho,1465.039,"because if henry puts"
bErptxD1jho,1466.64,"pressure on my neck all it takes is six"
bErptxD1jho,1469.679,"seconds and seven pounds of pressure to"
bErptxD1jho,1472.72,"render me"
bErptxD1jho,1473.36,"unconscious from this position six"
bErptxD1jho,1475.039,"seconds already just passed by the time"
bErptxD1jho,1476.32,"she said that you'll be unconscious"
bErptxD1jho,1477.76,"if he if i'm not able he's putting his"
bErptxD1jho,1479.36,"hands on my neck and i'm unable to get"
bErptxD1jho,1481.2,"it off"
bErptxD1jho,1482.08,"for any reason and you probably"
bErptxD1jho,1486.64,"you probably won't be able to figure it"
bErptxD1jho,1488.0,"out in the moment you can fight but if"
bErptxD1jho,1489.36,"someone's much heavier and stronger as"
bErptxD1jho,1490.799,"we assume the attacker will be in an"
bErptxD1jho,1492.159,"altercation"
bErptxD1jho,1493.2,"for any man or woman you're not"
bErptxD1jho,1494.72,"preparing self-defense to learn how to"
bErptxD1jho,1496.559,"defend yourself"
bErptxD1jho,1497.36,"from the person who's half your size"
bErptxD1jho,1498.799,"it's someone who physically has the"
bErptxD1jho,1499.919,"advantage so they're going for it right"
bErptxD1jho,1501.36,"here and if you don't know what to do"
bErptxD1jho,1502.48,"what would you probably try push"
bErptxD1jho,1503.919,"strike twist right bridge your hips"
bErptxD1jho,1506.159,"maybe hold the neck"
bErptxD1jho,1507.36,"which might work a little but then he"
bErptxD1jho,1508.48,"comes right back so if you're gonna"
bErptxD1jho,1509.679,"flail and go wild and all the while"
bErptxD1jho,1511.2,"you're burning energy that's the biggest"
bErptxD1jho,1512.64,"concern"
bErptxD1jho,1513.36,"so instead watch what eve does check"
bErptxD1jho,1514.72,"this out"
bErptxD1jho,1516.68,"[Music]"
bErptxD1jho,1518.72,"okay that was bonus good thank you very"
bErptxD1jho,1520.72,"much all right"
bErptxD1jho,1522.08,"let's go again you guys check this out"
bErptxD1jho,1524.0,"trap and roll standard variation and"
bErptxD1jho,1525.679,"then we'll do the punch block variation"
bErptxD1jho,1526.88,"so step one i mount"
bErptxD1jho,1528.159,"i'm attacking her chest or throat she's"
bErptxD1jho,1529.919,"going to want to push my hands off but"
bErptxD1jho,1530.96,"then she's going to remember no"
bErptxD1jho,1532.64,"don't push the hands off lock the arm in"
bErptxD1jho,1534.799,"watch what she did"
bErptxD1jho,1536.08,"so from here i trapped one side of this"
bErptxD1jho,1538.799,"body like"
bErptxD1jho,1539.36,"i tried we're going to show you first"
bErptxD1jho,1540.4,"then you guys can practice it partnered"
bErptxD1jho,1541.679,"and solo so just watch first just watch"
bErptxD1jho,1543.52,"i trapped his wrist"
bErptxD1jho,1545.36,"i trapped his arm and i trapped his foot"
bErptxD1jho,1548.32,"look at my leg my foot is locked under"
bErptxD1jho,1550.08,"her ankle"
bErptxD1jho,1550.799,"so now when i bridge my hips he has no"
bErptxD1jho,1553.76,"base point on this side if i didn't do"
bErptxD1jho,1555.919,"this"
bErptxD1jho,1556.64,"if i just bridge my hips his hands go"
bErptxD1jho,1558.4,"out and he can base out and you don't"
bErptxD1jho,1559.919,"have to know jiu jitsu"
bErptxD1jho,1561.84,"must instinctively post your hands out"
bErptxD1jho,1563.6,"anybody on the face of the earth who"
bErptxD1jho,1564.96,"falls is gonna post out to protect their"
bErptxD1jho,1566.64,"faces"
bErptxD1jho,1567.12,"it's a reflex you have since you're a"
bErptxD1jho,1568.32,"baby so he has that reflex too"
bErptxD1jho,1570.48,"but eve is going to preempt that by"
bErptxD1jho,1572.72,"risking the wrist"
bErptxD1jho,1574.08,"securing the elbow on my same arm she's"
bErptxD1jho,1576.32,"not trapping this arm"
bErptxD1jho,1577.279,"she's not trapping the other arm only"
bErptxD1jho,1578.799,"one side of my body so now when i bridge"
bErptxD1jho,1580.64,"it i can't"
bErptxD1jho,1581.279,"post he cannot post his arm out and now"
bErptxD1jho,1584.24,"i'm on top of the fight and we'll talk"
bErptxD1jho,1585.6,"about what to do from here and what your"
bErptxD1jho,1587.039,"options are"
bErptxD1jho,1587.76,"but let's go back to this let's look at"
bErptxD1jho,1589.12,"this grip i'm actually going to turn"
bErptxD1jho,1590.64,"this way"
bErptxD1jho,1591.36,"here slightly so from this grip whether"
bErptxD1jho,1594.159,"he has two hands or one hand we'll just"
bErptxD1jho,1595.52,"focus on one"
bErptxD1jho,1596.24,"one arm right now i'm going to bring my"
bErptxD1jho,1598.24,"opposite arm in"
bErptxD1jho,1600.159,"and i grab his wrist with what we call a"
bErptxD1jho,1602.32,"monkey grip"
bErptxD1jho,1603.52,"okay and we call it that because the"
bErptxD1jho,1605.36,"thumb is attached to the finger now i"
bErptxD1jho,1607.039,"don't know if monkeys actually have that"
bErptxD1jho,1608.72,"but"
bErptxD1jho,1609.12,"this is what i call monkey grip sloth"
bErptxD1jho,1610.559,"grip whatever you want to call it the"
bErptxD1jho,1612.32,"thumb"
bErptxD1jho,1613.039,"is connected to the fingers right as"
bErptxD1jho,1615.279,"opposed to this which would you see"
bErptxD1jho,1617.6,"grip and if she were to grab myself with"
bErptxD1jho,1618.799,"a c grip you guys right here my arm"
bErptxD1jho,1620.32,"would slip out"
bErptxD1jho,1621.039,"laterally pretty easily it's interesting"
bErptxD1jho,1623.039,"how even though this feels stronger"
bErptxD1jho,1624.799,"it's actually weaker for this use when"
bErptxD1jho,1626.72,"eve hooks my wrist with no thumb"
bErptxD1jho,1628.559,"it doesn't slip out laterally it's too"
bErptxD1jho,1630.24,"tight so now she glues that to her upper"
bErptxD1jho,1632.08,"clasp"
bErptxD1jho,1632.64,"grip now watch the elbow i bring my"
bErptxD1jho,1634.64,"elbow down to my rib cage and what i'm"
bErptxD1jho,1636.48,"using right now is my back"
bErptxD1jho,1638.159,"and my lats which are very strong and"
bErptxD1jho,1640.399,"actually stronger"
bErptxD1jho,1641.44,"than his lateral deltoids out over here"
bErptxD1jho,1643.679,"very strong by me"
bErptxD1jho,1644.88,"controlling this i can control his"
bErptxD1jho,1646.64,"ability to post his hand out"
bErptxD1jho,1648.159,"even if the attacker is much stronger i"
bErptxD1jho,1650.64,"can't post my hand out laterally anymore"
bErptxD1jho,1652.559,"she has too much power i don't have the"
bErptxD1jho,1653.76,"strength here but what i can do is do"
bErptxD1jho,1655.36,"this"
bErptxD1jho,1656.24,"so to preempt that back door escape"
bErptxD1jho,1658.159,"watch what her other hand does now this"
bErptxD1jho,1659.6,"one"
bErptxD1jho,1659.919,"is a c grip and it grabs on to tricep my"
bErptxD1jho,1662.399,"arm has essentially become part of eve's"
bErptxD1jho,1663.84,"body now imagine what the"
bErptxD1jho,1665.039,"attacker is thinking right now he's like"
bErptxD1jho,1666.799,"i got you and you're like sure you do"
bErptxD1jho,1669.36,"so she's solidifying my grip she's not"
bErptxD1jho,1671.2,"trying to get my hands off her neck"
bErptxD1jho,1672.64,"she's using my grip as an asset for her"
bErptxD1jho,1675.279,"so then she's going to trap the foot on"
bErptxD1jho,1676.559,"the side so don't trap the foot watch as"
bErptxD1jho,1678.64,"i even as i bridge he can post out his"
bErptxD1jho,1680.559,"foot and he will not roll"
bErptxD1jho,1682.48,"so what do we need we need to trap the"
bErptxD1jho,1684.399,"foot so watch what my foot does from"
bErptxD1jho,1686.159,"here"
bErptxD1jho,1687.039,"it just comes around and i trap it right"
bErptxD1jho,1689.039,"at his foot look how my knee is angled"
bErptxD1jho,1690.799,"out that's going to help me as i bridge"
bErptxD1jho,1693.279,"towards the side of the trapped arm"
bErptxD1jho,1694.96,"so here i've got everything secured one"
bErptxD1jho,1697.36,"other note look at my other foot"
bErptxD1jho,1698.96,"okay my other foot is very close to my"
bErptxD1jho,1700.72,"hips let's turn this way a little bit"
bErptxD1jho,1702.32,"so do not trap you're very close to my i"
bErptxD1jho,1704.48,"want to be here if i come"
bErptxD1jho,1706.08,"here and i bridge look what happens oh"
bErptxD1jho,1708.32,"he hooks"
bErptxD1jho,1709.12,"too i'm not gonna fall so instead watch"
bErptxD1jho,1711.6,"the leg comes out"
bErptxD1jho,1712.72,"and you want it very close to your hips"
bErptxD1jho,1715.6,"and on the inside of his leg not"
bErptxD1jho,1717.2,"trapping his other leg so we only want"
bErptxD1jho,1718.48,"one leg trapped and now we bridge now"
bErptxD1jho,1720.08,"for the fun part watch the hips"
bErptxD1jho,1721.52,"up up up up up and gravity does the rest"
bErptxD1jho,1724.32,"and now i'm on top"
bErptxD1jho,1725.12,"and for today's purposes you guys after"
bErptxD1jho,1726.48,"that bridge all i want to see is brace"
bErptxD1jho,1727.84,"both hands on my hips or rib cage or"
bErptxD1jho,1729.76,"stomach in this area"
bErptxD1jho,1730.799,"and now eve's going to jump up in base"
bErptxD1jho,1732.32,"watch her base"
bErptxD1jho,1734.159,"look at her legs one forward and one"
bErptxD1jho,1735.76,"back go again please do it wrong keep"
bErptxD1jho,1737.44,"your toes back"
bErptxD1jho,1738.08,"don't do a push back i don't want to see"
bErptxD1jho,1739.6,"that go back don't leave your toes back"
bErptxD1jho,1741.919,"you're going to jump with one foot in"
bErptxD1jho,1743.279,"front all the way to my pelvis when she"
bErptxD1jho,1744.88,"jumps up go"
bErptxD1jho,1745.52,"like i'm on a surfboard here boom strong"
bErptxD1jho,1747.6,"side back and then i push back here"
bErptxD1jho,1749.76,"okay so let's try that now if you have a"
bErptxD1jho,1751.6,"partner you can do that one safety tip"
bErptxD1jho,1753.6,"if you are going to do partner if you"
bErptxD1jho,1754.48,"don't have a partner you have to worry"
bErptxD1jho,1755.36,"about this partners i want you to put"
bErptxD1jho,1757.279,"one hand on the throat"
bErptxD1jho,1758.559,"so she can grab the wrists i'll put your"
bErptxD1jho,1760.32,"right hand on the throat"
bErptxD1jho,1762.159,"here wrist tricep and foot and partner"
bErptxD1jho,1764.48,"here's the key detail"
bErptxD1jho,1765.52,"put your other hand on the ground that's"
bErptxD1jho,1767.12,"going to allow you to support your"
bErptxD1jho,1768.0,"weight without choking your partner"
bErptxD1jho,1769.12,"during practice"
bErptxD1jho,1769.919,"and more importantly when they she rose"
bErptxD1jho,1771.36,"to roll me i want you to tuck your"
bErptxD1jho,1772.88,"shoulder you guys i don't want your"
bErptxD1jho,1773.84,"shoulder to hit the ground hard when you"
bErptxD1jho,1775.44,"get rolled if he's too straight up as i"

bErptxD1jho,1993.36,"likely happen you guys someone wants to"
bErptxD1jho,1994.559,"strangle you this is very common the"
bErptxD1jho,1996.0,"problem is"
bErptxD1jho,1996.799,"if the person mounts on you and instead"
bErptxD1jho,1999.039,"of trying to strangle you let's say they"
bErptxD1jho,2000.48,"go to the mount"
bErptxD1jho,2001.44,"and they instead want to punch your face"
bErptxD1jho,2003.039,"in so as i mount"
bErptxD1jho,2005.6,"i want to hit her if she doesn't know"
bErptxD1jho,2006.72,"what to do she's trying to grab my wrist"
bErptxD1jho,2008.32,"hold it boom"

bErptxD1jho,2022.96,"lands she's gonna lose her guard i'm"
bErptxD1jho,2024.24,"gonna land all of them"
bErptxD1jho,2025.36,"so this is a very normal response but it"
bErptxD1jho,2027.279,"just isn't very efficient"
bErptxD1jho,2028.64,"from a punch protection perspective so"
bErptxD1jho,2030.88,"if they're strangling you"
bErptxD1jho,2032.0,"you guys already know what to do if"
bErptxD1jho,2033.039,"they're not strangling the second that"
bErptxD1jho,2034.399,"they mount watch what eve does"
bErptxD1jho,2038.48,"now she climbs the tree traps the arm"
bErptxD1jho,2040.32,"and does the exact same thing"
bErptxD1jho,2042.0,"boom and then from here she's up in base"
bErptxD1jho,2043.919,"and she's out okay let's go again and"
bErptxD1jho,2045.519,"talk about what just happened"
bErptxD1jho,2046.88,"so once eve knows that i'm not grabbing"
bErptxD1jho,2048.639,"her throat which is immediate"
bErptxD1jho,2050.159,"watch what she does the second he mounts"
bErptxD1jho,2053.2,"i stood up and hug"
bErptxD1jho,2054.079,"because remember this movement we stood"
bErptxD1jho,2056.399,"up and hug his body from our warm up"
bErptxD1jho,2058.159,"my head is driving into his chest and"
bErptxD1jho,2060.24,"now i can push off my feet and bring him"
bErptxD1jho,2062.079,"to the ground now what's so interesting"
bErptxD1jho,2063.599,"about this"
bErptxD1jho,2064.48,"henna's hands have to be busy right"
bErptxD1jho,2066.96,"because if not"
bErptxD1jho,2068.079,"punching me his face is going to go into"
bErptxD1jho,2070.24,"the ground right because i'm pulling his"
bErptxD1jho,2072.48,"his body down with this so i'm sitting"
bErptxD1jho,2074.399,"up i can push off my feet and pull him"
bErptxD1jho,2076.159,"down"
bErptxD1jho,2076.879,"now from here i want to climb north on"
bErptxD1jho,2079.679,"his body i'm going to ratchet up his"
bErptxD1jho,2081.2,"body watch"
bErptxD1jho,2082.079,"so i go here i can push off my feet and"
bErptxD1jho,2084.159,"i bring myself up i want to peek just"
bErptxD1jho,2086.0,"over his shoulder here with my back arm"
bErptxD1jho,2089.359,"i can wrap"
bErptxD1jho,2090.24,"and hug closely keeping my body closed"
bErptxD1jho,2092.399,"it's all about closeness"
bErptxD1jho,2094.159,"now the other arm comes over the top and"
bErptxD1jho,2096.639,"i can trap his arm here"
bErptxD1jho,2098.48,"i bring it in and i control it okay"
bErptxD1jho,2100.48,"we'll talk about some safety tips here"
bErptxD1jho,2102.32,"if henry's finger is fingers are pointed"
bErptxD1jho,2104.72,"out"
bErptxD1jho,2105.44,"as i roll guess what's going to happen"
bErptxD1jho,2106.72,"to his fingers crunch ouch okay"
bErptxD1jho,2108.72,"so in a real situation don't tell him"
bErptxD1jho,2111.119,"but right now"
bErptxD1jho,2112.24,"tell your partner who you care about to"
bErptxD1jho,2115.119,"turn"
bErptxD1jho,2115.68,"and tuck okay rotate and tuck and make"
bErptxD1jho,2118.32,"sure that those hands are flat right"
bErptxD1jho,2119.68,"underneath your shoulder so you don't"
bErptxD1jho,2121.119,"hurt their fingers"
bErptxD1jho,2122.16,"so now i'm securing his arm and i've got"
bErptxD1jho,2124.96,"a leg trapped just like the last one"
bErptxD1jho,2126.56,"it's another version of the trap"
bErptxD1jho,2128.4,"and roll with my other arm i'm going to"
bErptxD1jho,2130.96,"underhook his armpit and reach"
bErptxD1jho,2132.8,"for two o'clock as i lift my hips"
bErptxD1jho,2136.16,"and i'm on top of the fight again from"
bErptxD1jho,2138.24,"here we disengage"
bErptxD1jho,2140.24,"okay so let's look at that again"
bErptxD1jho,2143.52,"so from the bottom immediately look i"
bErptxD1jho,2145.599,"sit up and hug so frustrating because"
bErptxD1jho,2146.96,"here's the rule in jiu jitsu you guys"
bErptxD1jho,2148.56,"whoever this is a rule in life in life"
bErptxD1jho,2150.64,"in fight life"
bErptxD1jho,2152.16,"whoever controls the distance controls"
bErptxD1jho,2155.44,"the damage that can be done"
bErptxD1jho,2157.52,"in the fight when eve blocks her face"
bErptxD1jho,2159.76,"and i'm sitting up here who's"
bErptxD1jho,2160.72,"controlling the distance"
bErptxD1jho,2162.0,"between my fist and her face i am she"
bErptxD1jho,2164.72,"has no influence on that distance it's"
bErptxD1jho,2166.64,"freeze for all"
bErptxD1jho,2167.52,"bomb bomb boom so that's why i can win"
bErptxD1jho,2170.88,"from here"
bErptxD1jho,2171.44,"what we're teaching you is how from the"
bErptxD1jho,2173.2,"bottom you can take over"
bErptxD1jho,2174.96,"the distance control and therefore take"
bErptxD1jho,2177.28,"over the potential for damage"
bErptxD1jho,2179.119,"in the fight so as soon as i mount"
bErptxD1jho,2180.96,"there's no discussion the second i mount"
bErptxD1jho,2183.04,"if i'm not grabbing her neck"
bErptxD1jho,2184.8,"she's hugging my torso and if i try to"
bErptxD1jho,2187.359,"take my hands"
bErptxD1jho,2188.079,"off the ground she does a little push"
bErptxD1jho,2190.4,"and pulls me down now safety tip"
bErptxD1jho,2192.0,"when you guys do that with your partner"
bErptxD1jho,2193.52,"don't pull too hard like you pull as"
bErptxD1jho,2195.52,"light as you can to get me down"
bErptxD1jho,2196.88,"that's all she needs if she goes real"
bErptxD1jho,2198.8,"hard it can arch my back right here and"
bErptxD1jho,2200.24,"i can tweak your person's back"
bErptxD1jho,2201.52,"here if you pull too tight in real life"
bErptxD1jho,2203.28,"pull as hard as you want but all eve"
bErptxD1jho,2205.04,"needs is that my hands touched down and"
bErptxD1jho,2206.4,"here's the key look at my head it's"
bErptxD1jho,2207.76,"glued to his chest"
bErptxD1jho,2209.119,"even if it's a little bit of distance"
bErptxD1jho,2210.72,"here henry can push inside"
bErptxD1jho,2213.2,"and create space so driving your head"
bErptxD1jho,2215.599,"into their chest is very important part"
bErptxD1jho,2217.28,"of it it's also very it's also very"
bErptxD1jho,2218.64,"awkward"
bErptxD1jho,2219.28,"it is you just met this guy in the"
bErptxD1jho,2220.8,"street fight he's mounted on you trying"
bErptxD1jho,2222.0,"to rip your face off and you're like"
bErptxD1jho,2223.839,"nuzzling up in his chest and this is why"
bErptxD1jho,2225.44,"we said distance management is so"
bErptxD1jho,2227.28,"counter-intuitive i mean"
bErptxD1jho,2228.48,"the distant part is is very all the way"
bErptxD1jho,2230.4,"out is easy all the way in is awkward"
bErptxD1jho,2232.24,"it's like what are we doing why am i"
bErptxD1jho,2233.599,"hugging this guy like a koala it's so"
bErptxD1jho,2235.44,"awkward you guys that it's also"
bErptxD1jho,2236.88,"counter intuitive which is why in a"
bErptxD1jho,2239.359,"violent altercation"
bErptxD1jho,2240.8,"the average person has no intuition to"
bErptxD1jho,2242.88,"go in"
bErptxD1jho,2243.92,"their intuition is to do this and to"
bErptxD1jho,2246.4,"kick a whip"
bErptxD1jho,2247.119,"and to do this and oh please and they're"
bErptxD1jho,2248.96,"getting punched the whole time"
bErptxD1jho,2250.4,"because it's so awkward to say no women"
bErptxD1jho,2252.32,"come in and grab someone"
bErptxD1jho,2253.68,"but the second you learn that closeness"
bErptxD1jho,2255.52,"is your second best friend"
bErptxD1jho,2257.2,"your first best friend is distance your"
bErptxD1jho,2260.079,"second best friend"
bErptxD1jho,2261.359,"is closeness your enemy is"
bErptxD1jho,2264.72,"in the middle right here because you're"
bErptxD1jho,2266.8,"punchable but you're not out but you're"
bErptxD1jho,2268.32,"not in and you're in great danger so if"
bErptxD1jho,2269.92,"you leave today"
bErptxD1jho,2270.8,"with one principle it's that you want to"
bErptxD1jho,2272.24,"be all the way in until help arrives"
bErptxD1jho,2274.56,"but that's so unnatural because you just"
bErptxD1jho,2276.72,"met this crazy animal who's trying to"
bErptxD1jho,2278.079,"punch your face off"
bErptxD1jho,2279.2,"so here's the move we're going to do it"
bErptxD1jho,2280.72,"together one more time then you're going"
bErptxD1jho,2282.079,"to"
bErptxD1jho,2282.32,"have a chance to practice it all solo"
bErptxD1jho,2283.599,"with me as i mount she's going to sit up"
bErptxD1jho,2285.599,"hug the tree i'm going to sit up she's"
bErptxD1jho,2287.68,"going to keep her head"

bErptxD1jho,2646.4,"why we have to climb the tree if she"
bErptxD1jho,2647.44,"tries to wrap this right now"
bErptxD1jho,2648.56,"it's too far north she has no leverage"
bErptxD1jho,2650.24,"she has no a lavanka"

bErptxD1jho,2684.16,"and uh tracy will throw them our way you"
bErptxD1jho,2686.0,"guys jan did ask"
bErptxD1jho,2687.92,"why do we climb the tree is it possible"
bErptxD1jho,2690.0,"to do that move without climbing so jan"
bErptxD1jho,2692.0,"asked why are we climbing the tree thank"
bErptxD1jho,2693.839,"you jan for the question why are we"
bErptxD1jho,2695.119,"climbing the tree and i think she asked"
bErptxD1jho,2696.48,"right before we just showed it"
bErptxD1jho,2698.079,"which is if you hug the tree and they're"
bErptxD1jho,2700.0,"posted way up here"
bErptxD1jho,2701.2,"you don't have the leverage jam to"
bErptxD1jho,2702.64,"actually break their arm down by"
bErptxD1jho,2704.16,"ratcheting up"
bErptxD1jho,2705.119,"you're changing the ratio and angle"
bErptxD1jho,2706.88,"between your armpit and their posted"
bErptxD1jho,2708.56,"hand"
bErptxD1jho,2708.96,"like eve said when your head peeks out"
bErptxD1jho,2711.04,"just past their shoulder"
bErptxD1jho,2712.24,"that's when you have all the leverage to"
bErptxD1jho,2714.24,"break that arm down now it's possible"
bErptxD1jho,2716.079,"that it's not possible to break their"
bErptxD1jho,2718.16,"arm down even in cases where you"
bErptxD1jho,2720.079,"sufficiently climb north it's possible"
bErptxD1jho,2721.92,"that it doesn't work and there are other"
bErptxD1jho,2723.68,"classes in the beginner programs through"
bErptxD1jho,2726.0,"zoom and online and ctcs"
bErptxD1jho,2728.079,"where you learn the techniques when you"
bErptxD1jho,2729.44,"can't break the arm down so just know"
bErptxD1jho,2731.359,"this like we teach you these scenarios"
bErptxD1jho,2733.28,"but it's possible that no the guy's"
bErptxD1jho,2734.96,"hands are too strong and too wide and"
bErptxD1jho,2736.319,"he's too big"
bErptxD1jho,2737.04,"that you cannot break the arm down it's"
bErptxD1jho,2738.72,"not like oh then we lose the fight"
bErptxD1jho,2740.319,"no then we go to lesson number eight or"
bErptxD1jho,2742.96,"lesson number 12"
bErptxD1jho,2743.92,"or lesson number 17. so there are"
bErptxD1jho,2745.76,"options in the curriculum you just have"
bErptxD1jho,2747.28,"to stick around for those"
bErptxD1jho,2748.4,"because we have other moves slated for"
bErptxD1jho,2749.839,"today that uh that we want to focus on"
bErptxD1jho,2751.92,"that are a little more important for"
bErptxD1jho,2752.88,"your intro"
bErptxD1jho,2754.079,"experience your fencer experience derek"
bErptxD1jho,2756.88,"asks what kind of grip is it when you"
bErptxD1jho,2758.56,"pull them down"
bErptxD1jho,2759.44,"yeah when you derek is asking what kind"
bErptxD1jho,2760.96,"of grip when you hug the tree as long as"
bErptxD1jho,2762.64,"it doesn't really matter"
bErptxD1jho,2763.52,"it might be an s grip might be a c clamp"
bErptxD1jho,2765.28,"on your own wrist feels it feels most"
bErptxD1jho,2766.8,"secure"
bErptxD1jho,2767.76,"if i can grab my own wrist but if i"
bErptxD1jho,2769.04,"can't reach that i can go to an s grip"
bErptxD1jho,2770.72,"which is your fingers"
bErptxD1jho,2771.92,"fingertips so maybe i can just grab"
bErptxD1jho,2773.52,"fingertips here or like we said maybe"
bErptxD1jho,2775.2,"you just have to hook here"
bErptxD1jho,2776.48,"and the reason why it doesn't matter"
bErptxD1jho,2777.52,"derek is because i can't compromise her"
bErptxD1jho,2780.079,"grips i can't reach them and i can't"
bErptxD1jho,2781.599,"peel them"
bErptxD1jho,2782.16,"therefore however she grabs is not going"
bErptxD1jho,2784.0,"to be a concern no matter what i'm doing"
bErptxD1jho,2786.16,"she's going to be able to pull much more"
bErptxD1jho,2788.56,"important than the grip"
bErptxD1jho,2789.599,"you guys is that she always puts my"
bErptxD1jho,2791.04,"hands on the ground this is so annoying"
bErptxD1jho,2793.04,"that every time i try to punch and"
bErptxD1jho,2794.24,"imagine if she's doing this because"
bErptxD1jho,2795.76,"think about andrea's situation"
bErptxD1jho,2797.28,"right where you manage the distance you"
bErptxD1jho,2798.48,"stay close it wasn't a mount there was"
bErptxD1jho,2799.839,"no amount there but i'm just saying a"
bErptxD1jho,2800.88,"violent situation in close quarters"
bErptxD1jho,2802.72,"where it's literally a 30-second stop"
bErptxD1jho,2804.8,"till the next opening of the train"
bErptxD1jho,2806.96,"so if she could only hug the body pull"
bErptxD1jho,2808.96,"someone close and just keep breaking"
bErptxD1jho,2810.8,"their posture"
bErptxD1jho,2811.599,"she doesn't even have to escape the"
bErptxD1jho,2813.28,"mount right even if you forgot the rest"
bErptxD1jho,2815.119,"of the technique just manage the"
bErptxD1jho,2816.56,"distance for 30 seconds but literally"
bErptxD1jho,2818.079,"that's called the elevator test i used"
bErptxD1jho,2819.599,"to always mention this where i'd say hey"
bErptxD1jho,2821.359,"would you have the skills to survive a"
bErptxD1jho,2822.88,"violent assault in an elevator"
bErptxD1jho,2824.8,"for 30 seconds for the time it takes to"
bErptxD1jho,2826.48,"get from one floor to the destination"
bErptxD1jho,2828.24,"floor do you have the skills to survive"
bErptxD1jho,2829.76,"that violence and we did the elevator"
bErptxD1jho,2830.96,"survival yeah video we did kind of in"
bErptxD1jho,2832.72,"response to that mindset well"
bErptxD1jho,2834.4,"the train is the same as the elevator"
bErptxD1jho,2835.92,"door shut it's exact transition and"
bErptxD1jho,2838.079,"doors open"
bErptxD1jho,2839.04,"and that's what we're trying to teach"
bErptxD1jho,2840.4,"you guys you just stay close and survive"
bErptxD1jho,2842.0,"weather the storm"
bErptxD1jho,2843.04,"and it's so difficult because in 30"
bErptxD1jho,2844.72,"seconds how much damage can be done"
bErptxD1jho,2847.359,"all of it someone can die yeah"
bErptxD1jho,2850.48,"getting brutally punched in 30 second"
bErptxD1jho,2852.079,"window especially with the weight"
bErptxD1jho,2853.28,"disparity that we saw"
bErptxD1jho,2854.24,"for andrea and the attacker in that"
bErptxD1jho,2856.96,"situation"
bErptxD1jho,2857.68,"you could die or you could stay close"
bErptxD1jho,2860.0,"get cuts and bruises and go straight"
bErptxD1jho,2861.599,"home afterwards because you're so fine"
bErptxD1jho,2863.04,"you're so close and you're so distance"
bErptxD1jho,2864.24,"managed"
bErptxD1jho,2864.72,"so that's what we're trying to teach you"
bErptxD1jho,2866.0,"is that you don't have to win the fight"
bErptxD1jho,2867.68,"to win the fight"
bErptxD1jho,2869.119,"you have to just survive the fight right"
bErptxD1jho,2871.2,"in a self-defense situation victory"
bErptxD1jho,2872.8,"isn't defined by points or time limits"
bErptxD1jho,2874.48,"or who even submits the other person"
bErptxD1jho,2876.319,"in a self-defense situation if a smaller"
bErptxD1jho,2878.16,"person is assaulted violently by a"
bErptxD1jho,2879.76,"larger person"
bErptxD1jho,2880.96,"victory is determined by you simply"
bErptxD1jho,2882.64,"going home and surviving the situation"
bErptxD1jho,2884.72,"and we want to give you the tools to"
bErptxD1jho,2885.599,"accomplish"
bErptxD1jho,2886.079,"that yeah so speaking of andrea's"
bErptxD1jho,2887.52,"situation we're gonna actually now talk"
bErptxD1jho,2889.68,"specifically about that one"
bErptxD1jho,2891.599,"if we are on our feet and someone comes"
bErptxD1jho,2894.559,"at us with punches and she was sitting"
bErptxD1jho,2896.24,"down on her phone when the initial"
bErptxD1jho,2897.359,"attack was initiated"
bErptxD1jho,2898.48,"which she is totally allowed to do right"
bErptxD1jho,2901.04,"right"
bErptxD1jho,2901.52,"and people always say well she should"
bErptxD1jho,2902.559,"have been on her phone or she shouldn't"
bErptxD1jho,2903.52,"have done this or she shouldn't have"
bErptxD1jho,2904.24,"been wearing that and generically in"
bErptxD1jho,2905.52,"terms of self defense you shouldn't walk"
bErptxD1jho,2907.04,"here you shouldn't walk there no"
bErptxD1jho,2908.24,"you should be able to walk anywhere eat"
bErptxD1jho,2910.559,"anything"
bErptxD1jho,2911.359,"drink anything wear anything"
bErptxD1jho,2914.48,"look at any phone for any period of time"
bErptxD1jho,2916.559,"during day or night you should be able"
bErptxD1jho,2918.319,"to do that"
bErptxD1jho,2919.44,"it's never the fault of the target"
bErptxD1jho,2922.48,"or the survivor that he or she was"
bErptxD1jho,2924.4,"attacked the truth is it's the fault of"
bErptxD1jho,2926.4,"the psychopath"
bErptxD1jho,2927.599,"who just hanging a bad day feels like"
bErptxD1jho,2929.28,"getting his stress out by beating"
bErptxD1jho,2930.48,"someone up is the solution to life"
bErptxD1jho,2932.319,"wrongly feeling that way right so it's"
bErptxD1jho,2934.319,"never the target's fault for being"
bErptxD1jho,2936.16,"attacked they didn't choose that"
bErptxD1jho,2937.92,"now that being said the fact that it's"
bErptxD1jho,2940.4,"never his or her fault for being"
bErptxD1jho,2942.24,"attacked"
bErptxD1jho,2943.2,"doesn't mean that we cannot invest in"
bErptxD1jho,2945.68,"skills"
bErptxD1jho,2946.319,"and resources tools and ideas that will"
bErptxD1jho,2949.28,"reduce"
bErptxD1jho,2950.0,"our likelihood of being targeted and if"
bErptxD1jho,2952.559,"targeted and attacked"
bErptxD1jho,2953.76,"will increase our survivability it"
bErptxD1jho,2955.76,"doesn't mean we can't invest in that"
bErptxD1jho,2957.04,"right it's not my fault that my house"
bErptxD1jho,2958.24,"gets robbed in the middle of the night"
bErptxD1jho,2959.68,"that's not my fault i should be able to"
bErptxD1jho,2961.2,"leave all my doors open and robbery is"
bErptxD1jho,2963.04,"not my fault it's the"
bErptxD1jho,2964.319,"attacker's craziness that does that"
bErptxD1jho,2966.64,"however"
bErptxD1jho,2967.359,"it doesn't mean we don't lock our doors"
bErptxD1jho,2969.04,"every single night"
bErptxD1jho,2970.559,"and take those precautions because if we"
bErptxD1jho,2972.4,"can deter the attack"
bErptxD1jho,2973.76,"it's much better now until the world is"
bErptxD1jho,2975.68,"peaceful and everyone's loving harmony"
bErptxD1jho,2977.52,"and nobody attacks or bullies or"
bErptxD1jho,2979.119,"sexually assaults or robs"
bErptxD1jho,2981.04,"until there's no criminals then until"
bErptxD1jho,2983.44,"that day comes"
bErptxD1jho,2984.4,"we have a we have an opportunity it's a"
bErptxD1jho,2986.72,"we have an opportunity it's your right"
bErptxD1jho,2988.48,"to invest"
bErptxD1jho,2989.359,"in your personal safety and protection"
bErptxD1jho,2991.359,"and that's why you're all here"
bErptxD1jho,2992.559,"thanks for joining us so let's stand up"
bErptxD1jho,2993.92,"but here's the deal we're going to stand"
bErptxD1jho,2994.88,"up and base we don't have to stand up"
bErptxD1jho,2996.079,"yet we're going to stand up and you're"
bErptxD1jho,2997.119,"going to stand up for the technique"
bErptxD1jho,2998.24,"but we're going to stand up and base"
bErptxD1jho,2999.44,"look we're watching you guys if we space"
bErptxD1jho,3002.18,"[Music]"
bErptxD1jho,3003.68,"so here's the deal in terms of a"
bErptxD1jho,3004.8,"standing situation you guys it's very"
bErptxD1jho,3006.72,"simple"
bErptxD1jho,3007.2,"i would like to especially in a close"
bErptxD1jho,3008.64,"quarters like we have right here"
bErptxD1jho,3010.24,"eve can only back up and run away so"
bErptxD1jho,3012.319,"much so the idea is if she can't run"
bErptxD1jho,3014.079,"away what should she do"
bErptxD1jho,3015.2,"and if you're here it's probably because"
bErptxD1jho,3016.4,"you've seen some of our videos but the"
bErptxD1jho,3018.24,"idea is all the way out"
bErptxD1jho,3019.52,"or all the way in and this all the way"
bErptxD1jho,3021.04,"out all the way in is measured"
bErptxD1jho,3022.64,"coincidentally by the same distance as"
bErptxD1jho,3024.96,"covet 19."
bErptxD1jho,3027.28,"six feet you guess it's funny i walk"
bErptxD1jho,3029.04,"around like all these stores now have"
bErptxD1jho,3030.72,"signs manage six foot distance six foot"
bErptxD1jho,3032.64,"just i'm like i was born for this"
bErptxD1jho,3034.72,"you know i'm saying like two hours i'm"
bErptxD1jho,3037.44,"at walmart"
bErptxD1jho,3038.16,"i'm at the best buy and i'm like okay no"
bErptxD1jho,3039.92,"worries there's no fight happening here"
bErptxD1jho,3041.52,"my covey distance is my life distance"
bErptxD1jho,3043.119,"you know so i'm straight"
bErptxD1jho,3044.0,"the point is jiu jitsu prepares you for"
bErptxD1jho,3045.52,"kovit okay until"
bErptxD1jho,3047.04,"you have to close the distance and then"
bErptxD1jho,3048.4,"all bets are off hopefully they're not"
bErptxD1jho,3049.68,"yeah yeah"
bErptxD1jho,3050.16,"you know we're straight all right so"
bErptxD1jho,3051.68,"this is this so two arms out two arm"
bErptxD1jho,3053.839,"length distance you guys and how do you"
bErptxD1jho,3055.04,"know two arms"
bErptxD1jho,3055.839,"if you put your two arms out this is the"
bErptxD1jho,3057.44,"deal because here's the alternative if i"
bErptxD1jho,3059.119,"go to assault eve"
bErptxD1jho,3060.079,"and just do a conventional eve defense"
bErptxD1jho,3061.76,"and like block my dad"
bErptxD1jho,3063.359,"she's getting hit and she's gonna get"
bErptxD1jho,3065.04,"bombarded and the thing is this"
bErptxD1jho,3066.72,"her attempt to maintain distance is"
bErptxD1jho,3068.88,"going to cause her to stay"
bErptxD1jho,3070.16,"at the perfect striking range that i"
bErptxD1jho,3072.72,"would like her to be"
bErptxD1jho,3073.839,"so she's actually doing my measuring"
bErptxD1jho,3075.599,"work for me"
bErptxD1jho,3076.96,"when she's just in this flustered"
bErptxD1jho,3078.24,"posting position and this is so natural"
bErptxD1jho,3080.16,"you guys we were just in denver last"
bErptxD1jho,3081.28,"week"
bErptxD1jho,3081.68,"teaching police officers right our law"
bErptxD1jho,3083.52,"enforcement gst course"
bErptxD1jho,3085.04,"and i'll tell you cops exact same"
bErptxD1jho,3087.92,"response"
bErptxD1jho,3088.72,"when they get ambushed and they don't"
bErptxD1jho,3089.92,"have their weapons drawn they're"
bErptxD1jho,3090.96,"flustered as any one of you guys no"
bErptxD1jho,3092.72,"different there's"
bErptxD1jho,3093.68,"zero percent difference so the point is"
bErptxD1jho,3095.76,"this is a natural human response to just"
bErptxD1jho,3097.599,"cover and retreat but it keeps you in"
bErptxD1jho,3099.52,"the striking range as we've seen in so"
bErptxD1jho,3101.2,"many viral videos where these assaults"
bErptxD1jho,3102.559,"happen"
bErptxD1jho,3103.2,"sometimes completely unexpected and"
bErptxD1jho,3105.119,"uncalled for right"
bErptxD1jho,3106.4,"so that's the problem is you don't want"
bErptxD1jho,3108.079,"to be there so if that's the problem"
bErptxD1jho,3109.28,"where do you want to be two arms out"
bErptxD1jho,3110.96,"here until i attack and then eve wants"
bErptxD1jho,3113.599,"to come in all the way in"
bErptxD1jho,3115.2,"and here's the point that you have to"
bErptxD1jho,3116.4,"understand when eve is this close even"
bErptxD1jho,3118.16,"though i can reach her"
bErptxD1jho,3119.92,"i can't knock her out because i'm only"
bErptxD1jho,3122.64,"using one"
bErptxD1jho,3123.44,"joint to hit her and if i'm only using"
bErptxD1jho,3125.599,"one joint that's called a level"
bErptxD1jho,3127.28,"one strike and strikes exist from levels"
bErptxD1jho,3130.16,"one through ten"
bErptxD1jho,3131.2,"look one joint if she was a little"
bErptxD1jho,3133.04,"further it's two joints my"
bErptxD1jho,3134.88,"shoulder's involved if she's a little"
bErptxD1jho,3136.72,"further my hips can be involved"
bErptxD1jho,3138.8,"if she's much further i can push off my"
bErptxD1jho,3140.4,"feet and that's how you escalate for"
bErptxD1jho,3141.839,"levels five six seven eight nine and ten"
bErptxD1jho,3143.68,"depending on how powerful the person is"
bErptxD1jho,3145.2,"the strike potential goes up"
bErptxD1jho,3146.96,"but when eve is this close she's"
bErptxD1jho,3148.8,"neutralizing all the dangerous strikes"
bErptxD1jho,3150.24,"that she's so close"
bErptxD1jho,3151.52,"and now here's the best part she spites"
bErptxD1jho,3153.28,"her teeth she holds on"
bErptxD1jho,3154.8,"she slams me into a wall potentially if"
bErptxD1jho,3157.2,"it's close quarters"
bErptxD1jho,3158.319,"and then she waits and when the elevator"
bErptxD1jho,3159.76,"door opens she bounces and she's gone"
bErptxD1jho,3162.4,"you guys"
bErptxD1jho,3163.359,"that's the whole point the safest place"
bErptxD1jho,3165.2,"is on the inside but it's so unnatural"
bErptxD1jho,3168.24,"unless you live in unless you grew up in"
bErptxD1jho,3170.0,"california in the ocean"
bErptxD1jho,3172.64,"because when you're a kid when you're a"
bErptxD1jho,3175.2,"kid playing in the water"
bErptxD1jho,3176.4,"all my life the wave starts to if it's a"
bErptxD1jho,3178.4,"little wave you can just kind of back"
bErptxD1jho,3179.599,"away and run away from it you can"
bErptxD1jho,3180.559,"usually get away from the little wave"
bErptxD1jho,3181.839,"that's"
bErptxD1jho,3182.079,"crumbling towards you but if you're"
bErptxD1jho,3183.52,"sitting there in the water and you start"
bErptxD1jho,3185.04,"to see a monster eight ten foot wave"
bErptxD1jho,3187.28,"swelling up on the horizon and your 11"
bErptxD1jho,3189.839,"year old kid what your dad and mom teach"
bErptxD1jho,3191.599,"you"
bErptxD1jho,3191.92,"is don't back up in the gracie family"
bErptxD1jho,3194.4,"because you're going to land"
bErptxD1jho,3195.52,"in the impact zone of the wave as soon"
bErptxD1jho,3198.079,"as you see the threat start to"
bErptxD1jho,3199.28,"legitimize itself you go as fast as you"
bErptxD1jho,3201.599,"can into it"
bErptxD1jho,3202.8,"and you get it before the impact and the"
bErptxD1jho,3204.4,"crumble and you swim under and it's no"
bErptxD1jho,3206.4,"problem but that's not natural if you"
bErptxD1jho,3208.319,"see a monster a non"
bErptxD1jho,3209.92,"a coloradian a coloradian goes like this"
bErptxD1jho,3212.4,"oh no here comes the wave and boom she"
bErptxD1jho,3214.16,"gets impact that's why eve hates the"
bErptxD1jho,3215.52,"water because she's land locked in"
bErptxD1jho,3216.64,"colorado i"
bErptxD1jho,3217.599,"i didn't grow up around the house the"
bErptxD1jho,3218.72,"point is you guys you gotta go at it and"
bErptxD1jho,3220.319,"it's the same for this it's unnatural"
bErptxD1jho,3221.839,"but it's so"
bErptxD1jho,3222.48,"necessary how can we convince you guys"
bErptxD1jho,3224.88,"that there's this no safer place"
bErptxD1jho,3226.319,"than on the inside so here's the idea"
bErptxD1jho,3228.319,"we're gonna start over here so we have"
bErptxD1jho,3229.2,"some range of motion"
bErptxD1jho,3230.24,"so two arm lengths away she's keeping"
bErptxD1jho,3231.839,"her distance as i'm walking towards her"
bErptxD1jho,3233.04,"she's staying i can't reach her"
bErptxD1jho,3234.4,"when i over commit to hit her she's"
bErptxD1jho,3236.319,"going to lunge in"
bErptxD1jho,3237.76,"boom protect her face and then she ends"
bErptxD1jho,3239.599,"up in this clinch talk about the"
bErptxD1jho,3240.8,"positioning of that clinch"
bErptxD1jho,3241.92,"should we start there start with the"
bErptxD1jho,3243.359,"positioning of the claims real quick"
bErptxD1jho,3244.559,"just so you can see"
bErptxD1jho,3245.359,"so from this final position this clinch"
bErptxD1jho,3247.599,"i'm wrapping my arm around his hips my"
bErptxD1jho,3249.52,"other arm"
bErptxD1jho,3250.0,"comes in and i'm grabbing my own wrist"
bErptxD1jho,3252.559,"here okay and i'm staying close now"
bErptxD1jho,3254.0,"watch"
bErptxD1jho,3254.559,"my foot positioning i have one foot on"
bErptxD1jho,3256.64,"the outside"
bErptxD1jho,3258.0,"of his foot here and then one in the"
bErptxD1jho,3259.76,"center we're almost like making a"
bErptxD1jho,3261.04,"triangle with our legs"
bErptxD1jho,3262.64,"my angle is about 45 degrees on his body"
bErptxD1jho,3265.44,"here"
bErptxD1jho,3266.079,"wrapping deep grabbing here and my head"
bErptxD1jho,3268.24,"is close and she's facing the center you"
bErptxD1jho,3269.92,"guys because it would be very awkward"
bErptxD1jho,3271.68,"if she was head outside like that or she"
bErptxD1jho,3273.599,"can get choked i could wrap her neck and"
bErptxD1jho,3275.52,"guillotine choke her"
bErptxD1jho,3276.64,"so as once you enter the clinch whatever"
bErptxD1jho,3278.24,"side your leg goes to look eve's foot is"
bErptxD1jho,3280.319,"on this side"
bErptxD1jho,3280.96,"that means she's looking this way if she"
bErptxD1jho,3282.559,"was on the other side"
bErptxD1jho,3284.24,"she would have her head facing the"

bErptxD1jho,3309.44,"strong"
bErptxD1jho,3310.079,"she's not very cooperative in the clinch"
bErptxD1jho,3311.839,"she's resisting making my life difficult"
bErptxD1jho,3313.68,"making me carry her weight"
bErptxD1jho,3315.359,"i'm not hanging my weight on his body"
bErptxD1jho,3317.359,"i'm almost making him carry my weight"
bErptxD1jho,3318.88,"instead of holding my own weight here so"
bErptxD1jho,3320.64,"once again i'm wrapping around the back"
bErptxD1jho,3322.16,"my other hand comes in and this is like"
bErptxD1jho,3324.0,"a"
bErptxD1jho,3324.4,"thing of it this forearm it's like a"
bErptxD1jho,3325.92,"crowbar around their back"
bErptxD1jho,3327.44,"and then you're grabbing that crowbar"
bErptxD1jho,3328.72,"and pulling it tight here it's so"
bErptxD1jho,3329.92,"annoying"
bErptxD1jho,3330.88,"and now the key is my head right so i"
bErptxD1jho,3333.2,"want to create"
bErptxD1jho,3334.319,"energy towards his chest and then making"
bErptxD1jho,3336.4,"sure my our feet are on the outside"
bErptxD1jho,3338.4,"right so head towards the center and"
bErptxD1jho,3340.16,"here and if you think about it when"
bErptxD1jho,3341.52,"someone's punching what do they want to"

bErptxD1jho,3344.799,"right they want their body to be forward"

bErptxD1jho,3355.119,"but if you can drive that head in energy"
bErptxD1jho,3357.44,"so that now they have to be upright it's"
bErptxD1jho,3359.04,"very difficult to land effective punches"

bErptxD1jho,3789.2,"moves deployment so when eve's in the"
bErptxD1jho,3790.88,"clinch"
bErptxD1jho,3791.68,"she's the one who decides when we"
bErptxD1jho,3793.44,"separate even though i decided"
bErptxD1jho,3795.359,"when we came together she decides when"
bErptxD1jho,3797.52,"she gets to disengage and i'm not"
bErptxD1jho,3798.96,"ready i'm hitting i'm doing whatever so"
bErptxD1jho,3800.319,"i have no idea so i can't hit her on the"
bErptxD1jho,3801.76,"way out if i didn't know"
bErptxD1jho,3803.2,"when she was gonna make her exit moment"
bErptxD1jho,3805.2,"opportunity happen"
bErptxD1jho,3806.4,"all right excellent so now what if"
bErptxD1jho,3808.319,"instead of disengaging"
bErptxD1jho,3809.599,"you decide this guy's a violent threat"
bErptxD1jho,3811.839,"if you let him go he's gonna attack"
bErptxD1jho,3813.359,"other people on the train"
bErptxD1jho,3814.4,"so you have to put him on his back and"
bErptxD1jho,3815.839,"you have to control and subdue this"
bErptxD1jho,3817.039,"person"
bErptxD1jho,3817.52,"well eve's ready for that so she steps"
bErptxD1jho,3819.2,"in for the clinch once she gets in watch"
bErptxD1jho,3820.799,"what she does"
bErptxD1jho,3821.52,"change levels was a little aggressive"
bErptxD1jho,3824.48,"but beautiful"
bErptxD1jho,3825.2,"and then she's in control for the map"
bErptxD1jho,3826.72,"and now she holds this guy down until he"
bErptxD1jho,3828.48,"either gives up or we do a submission"
bErptxD1jho,3829.92,"which we'll see next"
bErptxD1jho,3831.039,"body full take down you guys let's learn"
bErptxD1jho,3832.48,"it so eve's in the clinch watch how"
bErptxD1jho,3834.079,"beautiful"
bErptxD1jho,3834.96,"so this is a clinch take down tekken"
bErptxD1jho,3836.64,"there are many takedowns from different"
bErptxD1jho,3838.48,"configurations of two bodies what we're"
bErptxD1jho,3840.48,"showing is double under hook clinch so"
bErptxD1jho,3841.92,"eve is able to get under both of my arms"
bErptxD1jho,3843.44,"that's what you guys just learned double"
bErptxD1jho,3844.72,"underhook which is under both of mine"
bErptxD1jho,3846.4,"from the double underhook position it's"
bErptxD1jho,3847.76,"a great body fold some beautiful trips"
bErptxD1jho,3849.839,"and leg hooks you can use but the body"
bErptxD1jho,3851.44,"fold is one of our favorites to teach"
bErptxD1jho,3852.559,"beginners"
bErptxD1jho,3853.2,"because it's so easy to learn and so"
bErptxD1jho,3854.72,"effective in real combat especially if"
bErptxD1jho,3856.16,"the attacker is trying to hit you"
bErptxD1jho,3857.52,"which we can assume that they will so"
bErptxD1jho,3859.44,"from the clinch step one"
bErptxD1jho,3860.88,"is she's gonna change level she's gonna"
bErptxD1jho,3862.559,"drop down glue my hips to her body"
bErptxD1jho,3865.119,"and then as she picks me straight up"
bErptxD1jho,3866.48,"she's gonna bow at the top and then"
bErptxD1jho,3868.0,"she's gonna off balance me"
bErptxD1jho,3869.2,"and then she descends right in with me"
bErptxD1jho,3870.96,"to the full mount so it's a very strong"
bErptxD1jho,3872.72,"fold of my torso"
bErptxD1jho,3874.16,"which is really legitimized by the"
bErptxD1jho,3876.559,"degree to which she changes levels"
bErptxD1jho,3878.24,"sucks my hips in and then she stands up"
bErptxD1jho,3880.48,"and bow"
bErptxD1jho,3881.359,"then a little safety step and then the"
bErptxD1jho,3882.96,"descent happens okay so we'll do this"
bErptxD1jho,3884.799,"one one more time and then we'll do it"
bErptxD1jho,3885.839,"with you guys solo quick clinch"
bErptxD1jho,3887.119,"so we're already in the clinch here we"
bErptxD1jho,3888.559,"drop levels we secure it to work very"
bErptxD1jho,3890.72,"tight"
bErptxD1jho,3891.2,"as we go up we bow down we let go and we"
bErptxD1jho,3894.4,"end up"
bErptxD1jho,3895.039,"so it's so effective but it's also so"
bErptxD1jho,3896.72,"gentle you know to get the person to the"
bErptxD1jho,3898.079,"ground"
bErptxD1jho,3898.48,"so if you're solo everyone square up"
bErptxD1jho,3900.0,"face the camera please give yourself"
bErptxD1jho,3901.119,"some space in front of you i need space"

bErptxD1jho,3949.76,"tree you're gonna"
bErptxD1jho,3950.96,"pull it out if you were hugging the tree"
bErptxD1jho,3952.64,"you can't lift if you're too high so"
bErptxD1jho,3954.079,"watch this i want you all to change"
bErptxD1jho,3955.68,"levels hug the tree as tight as you can"
bErptxD1jho,3959.359,"from that hug stand up not all the way"
bErptxD1jho,3962.24,"almost 80"
bErptxD1jho,3963.599,"now at the top of your stand bow and"
bErptxD1jho,3966.64,"break the tree in half"

bErptxD1jho,4018.88,"go yeah so the key for partner practice"
bErptxD1jho,4020.559,"safety is the partner who's doing the"
bErptxD1jho,4021.92,"folding"
bErptxD1jho,4022.48,"if you keep holding you're going to fall"
bErptxD1jho,4024.559,"much more aggressively so the second"

bErptxD1jho,4040.319,"ground so let's be very careful make"
bErptxD1jho,4041.359,"sure you let go right after the feet"
bErptxD1jho,4042.4,"just fall straight like this it's gonna"
bErptxD1jho,4043.92,"spike your shoulders gonna suck"
bErptxD1jho,4045.119,"uncomfortably so everyone get in the"
bErptxD1jho,4046.319,"clinch left foot forward"

bErptxD1jho,4058.16,"saying that's a good indicator that you"
bErptxD1jho,4059.359,"let go sufficiently"
bErptxD1jho,4060.4,"if eve doesn't have to fall it's"
bErptxD1jho,4061.92,"actually a good way to start it's the"
bErptxD1jho,4063.039,"best way to start let's do it again so"
bErptxD1jho,4064.319,"let's try that"
bErptxD1jho,4065.039,"with the partners let's go again she"
bErptxD1jho,4066.4,"clinches she changes levels"
bErptxD1jho,4068.4,"she picks me up first fold release and"
bErptxD1jho,4071.52,"now do your baby step"
bErptxD1jho,4073.039,"come on down mount mountain out and"
bErptxD1jho,4074.72,"follow now in real life there isn't that"
bErptxD1jho,4076.48,"gap obviously"
bErptxD1jho,4077.68,"but eve is able to demonstrate that"
bErptxD1jho,4080.319,"beautifully"
bErptxD1jho,4081.52,"clinch change levels make sure you guys"
bErptxD1jho,4083.119,"are reversing rolls nice and tight"
bErptxD1jho,4084.88,"up we go fold me guys step then she"
bErptxD1jho,4087.599,"descends very casually"
bErptxD1jho,4088.88,"and i'm sitting down following myself to"
bErptxD1jho,4090.559,"the ground either side everybody switch"
bErptxD1jho,4092.799,"sides or switch partners front to back"
bErptxD1jho,4094.4,"reversing rolls"
bErptxD1jho,4095.599,"now henrik and it's good to see a big"
bErptxD1jho,4097.6,"person doing it on a smaller person"
bErptxD1jho,4099.12,"you don't have to ask me twice yeah so"
bErptxD1jho,4100.56,"look so i'm in the clinch fast face me"
bErptxD1jho,4102.159,"so from here i'm going to wrap her up"
bErptxD1jho,4103.679,"grab her body my leg is on the outside i"
bErptxD1jho,4105.759,"have her hips she's here i'm staying"
bErptxD1jho,4107.279,"close i'm going to change levels"
bErptxD1jho,4108.56,"pull tight lift little fold step and i"
bErptxD1jho,4110.719,"let her go and then my hands separately"
bErptxD1jho,4112.96,"come in and go it's amazing you guys"
bErptxD1jho,4114.799,"once you break someone's posture their"
bErptxD1jho,4116.159,"lower back and you fold them"
bErptxD1jho,4117.759,"it doesn't take much once they go past"
bErptxD1jho,4119.679,"45 degrees"
bErptxD1jho,4120.96,"they're going down they're they're going"
bErptxD1jho,4123.199,"and all you have to do is tag along"
bErptxD1jho,4124.719,"and ride them down to the bottom it's so"
bErptxD1jho,4126.0,"effective and you know what makes it"
bErptxD1jho,4127.04,"more effective"
bErptxD1jho,4128.239,"is that when they're trying to hit you"
bErptxD1jho,4129.52,"look she clenches me"
bErptxD1jho,4131.359,"they don't like this at all right so"
bErptxD1jho,4132.4,"what are they gonna try to do hit hit"
bErptxD1jho,4133.52,"hit but i'm falling"
bErptxD1jho,4134.719,"because my hitting causes me to lean"
bErptxD1jho,4137.04,"back"
bErptxD1jho,4137.759,"and the more backward leaning i am the"
bErptxD1jho,4139.679,"more typical i am in that situation so"
bErptxD1jho,4141.52,"it's super effective"
bErptxD1jho,4142.88,"for that cool last one together let's go"
bErptxD1jho,4145.359,"now let's put it together let's put it"

bErptxD1jho,4226.56,"the ease which controls my center mass"
bErptxD1jho,4228.32,"and then is able to"
bErptxD1jho,4229.679,"fold me in half is incredibly effective"
bErptxD1jho,4231.28,"he's one of the best takedowns for a"
bErptxD1jho,4232.64,"street fight against someone who's"
bErptxD1jho,4233.52,"trying to hit you because their arms are"
bErptxD1jho,4234.88,"flailing"
bErptxD1jho,4235.44,"but you control center mass your head is"
bErptxD1jho,4237.36,"buried for safety"
bErptxD1jho,4238.56,"and that's it once you understand that"
bErptxD1jho,4240.159,"if you control someone's center mass if"
bErptxD1jho,4242.159,"you can control their hips they're so"
bErptxD1jho,4244.0,"you can control so much"
bErptxD1jho,4245.199,"which is the same way we don't want our"
bErptxD1jho,4246.48,"hips controlled right there's so much"
bErptxD1jho,4247.84,"control from there"
bErptxD1jho,4248.96,"that's very difficult to get away yeah"
bErptxD1jho,4251.199,"everything"
bErptxD1jho,4252.239,"three people just ask right now number"
bErptxD1jho,4253.76,"one what if you strike during the clinch"
bErptxD1jho,4255.12,"we already talked about if they strike"
bErptxD1jho,4256.239,"you during the clinch it's okay it's"
bErptxD1jho,4257.52,"called the level one strike"
bErptxD1jho,4259.12,"and here's the beauty with level one and"
bErptxD1jho,4260.4,"they will probably strike you during the"
bErptxD1jho,4261.6,"clinch and that's important too"
bErptxD1jho,4263.04,"exactly right level one strikes you guys"
bErptxD1jho,4265.44,"are more exhausting to the strike"
bErptxD1jho,4267.44,"thrower"
bErptxD1jho,4268.4,"than they are damaging to the strike"

bErptxD1jho,4273.04,"it's like oh we're gambling and every"
bErptxD1jho,4274.96,"time i spend one dollar"

bErptxD1jho,4285.6,"i know i'm drawing her into an equation"
bErptxD1jho,4287.44,"of eventual"
bErptxD1jho,4288.88,"complete um debt she's gonna go into"
bErptxD1jho,4291.44,"zero very quickly"
bErptxD1jho,4292.48,"right she's gonna exhaust her resources"
bErptxD1jho,4293.92,"more rapidly so these strikes are very"
bErptxD1jho,4295.6,"useless now the other question was what"
bErptxD1jho,4296.88,"if you can't pick someone up"
bErptxD1jho,4298.159,"that's when you do lesson number four or"
bErptxD1jho,4300.0,"lesson number six or lesson number 17."
bErptxD1jho,4302.48,"other lessons have the techniques that"
bErptxD1jho,4304.32,"will teach you takedowns when the body"
bErptxD1jho,4305.92,"fold isn't possible"
bErptxD1jho,4307.36,"that's the beauty of jiu-jitsu"
bErptxD1jho,4308.8,"specifically gracie combatives and our"
bErptxD1jho,4310.8,"beginner programs"
bErptxD1jho,4311.84,"is that we contemplate all the most"
bErptxD1jho,4313.44,"likely threat scenarios and then we ask"
bErptxD1jho,4315.199,"ourselves okay"
bErptxD1jho,4316.0,"what are the most effective techniques"
bErptxD1jho,4317.36,"for these and if this one doesn't work"
bErptxD1jho,4318.719,"what are two other options for the same"
bErptxD1jho,4320.239,"scenario they can apply"
bErptxD1jho,4321.52,"that's what makes this program so"
bErptxD1jho,4322.96,"cohesive versus just learning random"
bErptxD1jho,4325.12,"techniques"
bErptxD1jho,4325.76,"that really don't all come back together"
bErptxD1jho,4327.199,"but of course we can't cover all 36"
bErptxD1jho,4329.199,"techniques today we're covering about"
bErptxD1jho,4330.56,"five"
bErptxD1jho,4331.04,"or six but right now yeah the other"
bErptxD1jho,4333.28,"thing i'll say about"
bErptxD1jho,4334.159,"what if somebody punches you from close"
bErptxD1jho,4335.679,"quarters it's important to recognize and"
bErptxD1jho,4337.199,"that's why i say"
bErptxD1jho,4338.08,"that you will get punched and so it's"
bErptxD1jho,4339.679,"important to recognize that because"
bErptxD1jho,4341.36,"if i'm in this position and i do get"
bErptxD1jho,4344.08,"puts from this"
bErptxD1jho,4344.96,"these ones and twos and i'm so"
bErptxD1jho,4346.4,"distracted by that punch at night"
bErptxD1jho,4348.96,"now it's gonna get worse that i now let"
bErptxD1jho,4350.56,"go and address those"
bErptxD1jho,4352.159,"ones and twos i put myself at the range"
bErptxD1jho,4354.48,"of tens or eights or tens"
bErptxD1jho,4356.159,"right so that's why it's so important to"
bErptxD1jho,4358.239,"acknowledge that"
bErptxD1jho,4359.84,"we might get punched here but a punch"
bErptxD1jho,4361.6,"from this distance"
bErptxD1jho,4363.04,"is way better than a punch from this one"
bErptxD1jho,4365.92,"arm distance away"
bErptxD1jho,4367.04,"and your overreaction which is a kind of"
bErptxD1jho,4368.88,"a life ending or fight ending punch in"
bErptxD1jho,4370.64,"that situation you called it the"
bErptxD1jho,4371.84,"overreaction"
bErptxD1jho,4372.8,"to the ones and twos by amateur"
bErptxD1jho,4375.04,"untrained people"
bErptxD1jho,4376.48,"is what exposes them to the nines and"
bErptxD1jho,4378.8,"tens think about that you guys"
bErptxD1jho,4380.64,"so as important as it is how to know to"
bErptxD1jho,4382.4,"block punches it's also important to"
bErptxD1jho,4384.719,"know when"
bErptxD1jho,4385.44,"not to address the punches this is so"
bErptxD1jho,4388.4,"major"
bErptxD1jho,4388.96,"but this is not intuitive you have to"
bErptxD1jho,4390.4,"learn this and that's what we're talking"
bErptxD1jho,4392.239,"about in gracie combatives now right now"
bErptxD1jho,4394.239,"we have two missions number one you have"
bErptxD1jho,4395.52,"to drink a little bit of water number"
bErptxD1jho,4396.96,"two"
bErptxD1jho,4397.36,"you have to get a prop this is our 50"
bErptxD1jho,4398.88,"yard line right now we're taking a"
bErptxD1jho,4399.92,"little three minute break"
bErptxD1jho,4401.12,"to get props and water so drink some"
bErptxD1jho,4404.32,"water i'm gonna drink some and i'm gonna"
bErptxD1jho,4405.44,"run to my closet right now"
bErptxD1jho,4406.719,"you need to bring back a hoodie everyone"
bErptxD1jho,4408.239,"go get a hooded sweatshirt"
bErptxD1jho,4410.159,"uh if it turns into a backpack and it's"
bErptxD1jho,4412.48,"quick flip you get 10 extra points"
bErptxD1jho,4414.0,"if it's just a regular hooded sweatshirt"
bErptxD1jho,4415.52,"of any kind has to have a hood"
bErptxD1jho,4417.12,"has to have two arms and it has to be a"
bErptxD1jho,4418.8,"sweatshirt or a jacket"
bErptxD1jho,4420.48,"bring it back as long as it has a hood"
bErptxD1jho,4421.84,"and two arms you can use it for our next"
bErptxD1jho,4423.44,"technique"
bErptxD1jho,4424.159,"all right so check it out everyone lay"
bErptxD1jho,4425.44,"their hoodie down here's what we're"
bErptxD1jho,4426.8,"going to do we're going to teach you"
bErptxD1jho,4427.679,"this technique first then we'll use our"
bErptxD1jho,4428.64,"hoodie actually don't land down here i'm"
bErptxD1jho,4429.84,"going to say no"
bErptxD1jho,4430.719,"bring the body what it actually looks"
bErptxD1jho,4432.32,"like move back a little bit so let's say"
bErptxD1jho,4433.679,"eve let's say eve takes down the guy on"
bErptxD1jho,4435.6,"the train like for real body full take"
bErptxD1jho,4437.36,"down"
bErptxD1jho,4437.76,"she achieves the full amount she gets in"
bErptxD1jho,4439.76,"she's here now if eve achieves full"
bErptxD1jho,4441.52,"mount you guys"
bErptxD1jho,4442.48,"number one she wants to hold this guy"
bErptxD1jho,4443.76,"down right which is great number two"
bErptxD1jho,4445.28,"eventually after holding him down for a"
bErptxD1jho,4446.64,"while she may look to gain compliance"
bErptxD1jho,4448.4,"right and that can be done by many ways"
bErptxD1jho,4450.239,"one if you don't know what you're doing"
bErptxD1jho,4451.6,"top person man or woman and you stood up"
bErptxD1jho,4453.679,"you're gonna probably do what boom boom"
bErptxD1jho,4455.36,"boom brutalize them with punches"
bErptxD1jho,4457.199,"and yeah that could be effective the"
bErptxD1jho,4459.199,"problem with punches as a means of"
bErptxD1jho,4460.4,"victory is because eve is so tall"
bErptxD1jho,4462.159,"she's also very pushable she's very"
bErptxD1jho,4463.84,"bench pressable because she's so light"
bErptxD1jho,4465.679,"and so tall"
bErptxD1jho,4466.719,"so sitting up to strike could be kind of"
bErptxD1jho,4468.48,"productive not to mention what other"
bErptxD1jho,4470.08,"concerns are there with punching as it"
bErptxD1jho,4471.12,"means to victory"
bErptxD1jho,4472.64,"um i guess i could be punched as well"
bErptxD1jho,4476.32,"yeah from here it's gonna be tough right"
bErptxD1jho,4478.0,"i guess are you considering that i might"
bErptxD1jho,4479.679,"care about you"
bErptxD1jho,4480.84,"yes that you live in america if you live"
bErptxD1jho,4482.88,"in america"
bErptxD1jho,4483.679,"there's also a legal implication now"
bErptxD1jho,4485.76,"imagine if we switch roles and i mount"
bErptxD1jho,4487.28,"on eve"
bErptxD1jho,4488.159,"right and i'm punching her facing as my"
bErptxD1jho,4490.08,"means of controlling her"
bErptxD1jho,4491.28,"yeah i'm gonna break her face man versus"
bErptxD1jho,4492.96,"a man but you happen to be a bigger man"
bErptxD1jho,4494.719,"but you're still controlling a violent"
bErptxD1jho,4496.159,"smaller man right and you start doing"
bErptxD1jho,4498.32,"this well now you may be sued because"
bErptxD1jho,4501.04,"you break your personality so here's how"
bErptxD1jho,4503.76,"crazy self-defense isn't just defending"
bErptxD1jho,4505.52,"against the attack"
bErptxD1jho,4506.719,"self-defense is defending against the"
bErptxD1jho,4508.32,"lawsuit that comes"
bErptxD1jho,4510.32,"when you defend against the attack"
bErptxD1jho,4512.0,"without jujitsu efficiency and"
bErptxD1jho,4513.44,"effectiveness"
bErptxD1jho,4514.32,"let's rephrase it so what's beautiful"
bErptxD1jho,4515.92,"about jiu jitsu is you can protect"
bErptxD1jho,4517.28,"yourself"
bErptxD1jho,4517.84,"and protect this person at the same time"
bErptxD1jho,4519.76,"to the degree that you want to we're"
bErptxD1jho,4521.44,"lovers you guys not fighting right so we"
bErptxD1jho,4523.199,"can"
bErptxD1jho,4524.4,"protect them as well as protecting"
bErptxD1jho,4526.08,"ourselves and the ability to do both"
bErptxD1jho,4527.84,"is amazing now it may be a situation"
bErptxD1jho,4530.0,"where that's not your concern whatsoever"
bErptxD1jho,4532.0,"and you do what you got to do"
bErptxD1jho,4533.28,"but knowing that if your drunk uncle"
bErptxD1jho,4535.52,"gets crazy at a party and you need to"
bErptxD1jho,4536.88,"hold him down you're not going to give"
bErptxD1jho,4537.92,"him a black eye and like"
bErptxD1jho,4539.12,"bloody his face off right so just the"
bErptxD1jho,4541.52,"ability to control somebody that's what"
bErptxD1jho,4542.96,"we're going to see right now so check"
bErptxD1jho,4544.239,"this out the americana arm lock"
bErptxD1jho,4545.76,"the most basic this is taught in lesson"
bErptxD1jho,4547.44,"number two of gracie combatives"
bErptxD1jho,4549.04,"the most basic submission but one of the"
bErptxD1jho,4550.64,"most reliable for gaining compliance"
bErptxD1jho,4552.4,"in a street fighter situation where this"
bErptxD1jho,4553.92,"person doesn't know jujitsu they're here"
bErptxD1jho,4555.52,"blocking their face"
bErptxD1jho,4556.4,"she goes two on one she's gonna lock it"

bErptxD1jho,4579.52,"how to do it solo you guys we're gonna"
bErptxD1jho,4580.719,"have a lot of fun with this one two on"
bErptxD1jho,4581.92,"one wrist control elbow control and i'm"
bErptxD1jho,4583.76,"just"
bErptxD1jho,4584.08,"pushing it to the ground i drive it to"
bErptxD1jho,4586.4,"the ground here"
bErptxD1jho,4587.28,"i wedge my elbow let's actually turn"
bErptxD1jho,4589.6,"this way a little bit there we go"
bErptxD1jho,4590.96,"i went to my elbow in his neck"
bErptxD1jho,4593.28,"controlling the angle of his butt of his"
bErptxD1jho,4595.04,"arm here"
bErptxD1jho,4596.0,"my other hand comes underneath and i go"
bErptxD1jho,4598.4,"palm"
bErptxD1jho,4599.04,"up underneath and now i grab my own"
bErptxD1jho,4602.48,"wrist double monkey grips here"
bErptxD1jho,4605.52,"and now from here my head can come down"
bErptxD1jho,4607.6,"and we'll just look at the actual"
bErptxD1jho,4609.12,"technique here we'll not talk about our"
bErptxD1jho,4610.48,"legs yet but we will"
bErptxD1jho,4612.56,"drag and put pressure there and what"
bErptxD1jho,4614.8,"makes this hurt you guys because right"
bErptxD1jho,4615.92,"here most common mistake is they lift"
bErptxD1jho,4617.36,"this elbow"
bErptxD1jho,4618.0,"i feel nothing the reason why it hurts"
bErptxD1jho,4620.48,"is because eve is taking my hand and"
bErptxD1jho,4622.32,"sliding it"
bErptxD1jho,4623.04,"south when she takes my hand almost like"
bErptxD1jho,4625.12,"she's trying to touch her own knee see"
bErptxD1jho,4626.56,"her knee right here"
bErptxD1jho,4627.44,"like put my hand on your knee look at"
bErptxD1jho,4628.8,"that look at that look that's what hurts"
bErptxD1jho,4630.48,"and what she does is all her weight is"
bErptxD1jho,4633.199,"is being weighted on her elbow the only"
bErptxD1jho,4635.12,"part of her upper body"
bErptxD1jho,4636.0,"that doesn't move is this elbow on the"
bErptxD1jho,4637.36,"ground next to my neck so she slides her"
bErptxD1jho,4639.36,"hand slides her elbow up"
bErptxD1jho,4640.88,"and she twists other side look two on"
bErptxD1jho,4643.04,"one so two on one"
bErptxD1jho,4645.36,"what you'll notice is that in order to"
bErptxD1jho,4646.56,"get his arm down if it's arm strength"
bErptxD1jho,4648.32,"versus arm strength he might be able to"
bErptxD1jho,4650.719,"out strength me from here so instead"
bErptxD1jho,4653.84,"look"
bErptxD1jho,4654.239,"stiffen your arms and put your entire"
bErptxD1jho,4655.84,"body weight and that's how you get their"
bErptxD1jho,4657.04,"arms down"
bErptxD1jho,4657.679,"so monkey grip you can stiffen your arms"
bErptxD1jho,4659.52,"bring it down here and now i wedge my"
bErptxD1jho,4661.199,"elbow in it has to"
bErptxD1jho,4662.4,"be connected right if this is loose it's"
bErptxD1jho,4664.48,"too hard to control so we have to"
bErptxD1jho,4666.48,"have an anchor point which is his neck"
bErptxD1jho,4668.48,"the crook of his neck and his shoulder"
bErptxD1jho,4669.679,"shoulder"
bErptxD1jho,4670.08,"sneaker now from here i want to get"
bErptxD1jho,4671.92,"underneath the elbow i do that look palm"
bErptxD1jho,4673.92,"most people do it palm down most people"
bErptxD1jho,4675.52,"will do this if i could resist my elbow"
bErptxD1jho,4677.84,"but she goes palms up palm up i can just"
bErptxD1jho,4679.76,"reach in like"
bErptxD1jho,4680.56,"digging underneath and once i clear"
bErptxD1jho,4683.36,"watch the hand switch"
bErptxD1jho,4684.8,"now it's palm down palm down and i grab"
bErptxD1jho,4687.36,"my own"
bErptxD1jho,4688.159,"wrist here okay and this is all just"
bErptxD1jho,4691.52,"connected right because what i don't"
bErptxD1jho,4692.88,"want to see is this"
bErptxD1jho,4694.88,"so this has to be controlled we're here"
bErptxD1jho,4697.12,"let's get back a little bit up"
bErptxD1jho,4698.64,"up up up that way there we go yes so now"
bErptxD1jho,4700.64,"we're from here"
bErptxD1jho,4702.08,"um yes so so the we're our grips our"
bErptxD1jho,4704.8,"monkey grips right here double grips"
bErptxD1jho,4706.96,"and then the head is low he's going to"
bErptxD1jho,4709.199,"try to scratch or poke you you want to"
bErptxD1jho,4710.4,"slide and lift now she's going to go"
bErptxD1jho,4711.44,"down now we're going to"
bErptxD1jho,4712.159,"now two things to think about there's"
bErptxD1jho,4713.84,"two movements happening at once"
bErptxD1jho,4716.08,"the first is that the elbow is being"
bErptxD1jho,4717.6,"lifted but as header mentioned if we"
bErptxD1jho,4719.28,"just lift the elbow nothing happens"
bErptxD1jho,4721.36,"so as we're lifting the elbow we're also"
bErptxD1jho,4724.0,"painting the ground with his hand"
bErptxD1jho,4726.8,"okay and if i just paint the ground"
bErptxD1jho,4728.32,"nothing happens either right"
bErptxD1jho,4730.0,"so i have to lift and paint"
bErptxD1jho,4733.28,"at the same time bad guy tap out that's"
bErptxD1jho,4735.28,"how you indicate uh discomfort and do"
bErptxD1jho,4737.199,"that before your arm breaks preferably"
bErptxD1jho,4738.8,"yes"
bErptxD1jho,4739.36,"please so tapping means stop okay so"
bErptxD1jho,4741.6,"when you feel a tap that means let go"
bErptxD1jho,4743.12,"and it doesn't mean stop right there"
bErptxD1jho,4744.48,"it means the moment you feel it look you"
bErptxD1jho,4746.56,"will let you release"
bErptxD1jho,4747.6,"everything okay you don't hold it there"
bErptxD1jho,4749.6,"awesome okay let's do that again"
bErptxD1jho,4751.199,"i'm gonna do with the thing thank you"
bErptxD1jho,4752.88,"okay everyone get your hoodies now let's"
bErptxD1jho,4754.159,"get ready"

bErptxD1jho,4757.92,"out to the side everyone's solo with"

bErptxD1jho,5103.52,"jiu jitsu is the art that can be done"
bErptxD1jho,5106.8,"on someone much bigger than you that's"
bErptxD1jho,5108.4,"why you're on this web stream"
bErptxD1jho,5110.159,"instead of any other web stream this"
bErptxD1jho,5111.76,"morning of martial arts i don't care how"
bErptxD1jho,5113.6,"many there are in the world you chose"
bErptxD1jho,5114.8,"the right one"
bErptxD1jho,5116.08,"because the only reason the gracie"
bErptxD1jho,5117.679,"family is here the only reason the world"
bErptxD1jho,5119.12,"is in love with juju right now is one if"
bErptxD1jho,5120.719,"you had to summarize one reason"
bErptxD1jho,5122.4,"it's the only martial art that has"
bErptxD1jho,5124.48,"consistently proven"
bErptxD1jho,5125.679,"that you can learn it as a smaller"
bErptxD1jho,5127.84,"person and use it effectively against a"
bErptxD1jho,5129.76,"larger more athletic person so the"
bErptxD1jho,5131.52,"answer to every move for the rest of"
bErptxD1jho,5132.96,"your life"
bErptxD1jho,5133.6,"can this be done on someone larger if"
bErptxD1jho,5135.04,"we're teaching it yes"
bErptxD1jho,5136.639,"now depending on the size larger we're"
bErptxD1jho,5139.199,"talking 100 pounds 200 pounds or 500"
bErptxD1jho,5141.12,"pounds larger"
bErptxD1jho,5142.0,"certain techniques will be inhibited a"
bErptxD1jho,5143.52,"little bit and have to be modified"
bErptxD1jho,5145.199,"but the reason this art exists and is so"
bErptxD1jho,5147.04,"prominent and so successful"
bErptxD1jho,5148.48,"is because it's proven consistently over"
bErptxD1jho,5150.48,"time 100 years almost"
bErptxD1jho,5152.0,"that it's the only art there is no other"
bErptxD1jho,5153.6,"art with the same track record of"
bErptxD1jho,5155.36,"success"
bErptxD1jho,5156.159,"for smaller people to be effective"
bErptxD1jho,5158.639,"against larger attackers in real fights"
bErptxD1jho,5161.36,"than jiu jitsu and what you'll never"
bErptxD1jho,5163.199,"hear us say"
bErptxD1jho,5164.8,"is go harder or punch you know go"
bErptxD1jho,5167.84,"faster and it's not it's not going to be"
bErptxD1jho,5170.639,"a matter of how strong you are"
bErptxD1jho,5172.4,"right so we didn't say you know you have"
bErptxD1jho,5174.719,"to pull as strong as"
bErptxD1jho,5175.84,"strong as you can it's all about"
bErptxD1jho,5176.96,"leverage it's about these principles of"
bErptxD1jho,5178.719,"distance management"
bErptxD1jho,5179.76,"of applying leverage of finding ways to"
bErptxD1jho,5182.0,"use the stronger parts of your body like"
bErptxD1jho,5183.92,"this is what this is like hips"
bErptxD1jho,5185.84,"and back against one arm yes one arm"
bErptxD1jho,5188.8,"your entire body"
bErptxD1jho,5190.32,"against one arm right now here so once"
bErptxD1jho,5192.639,"we create those"
bErptxD1jho,5193.6,"you can create that uh you know that"
bErptxD1jho,5196.0,"that leverage"
bErptxD1jho,5196.719,"of an entire body versus one body part"
bErptxD1jho,5198.88,"then that's why it's so effective"
bErptxD1jho,5200.56,"absolutely cool all right let's do it if"
bErptxD1jho,5202.56,"you fall off in the mouth check this out"
bErptxD1jho,5203.92,"so now eve is mounted it's very possible"
bErptxD1jho,5205.92,"that she's mounted and someone's so"
bErptxD1jho,5207.44,"strong that before she's able to lock it"
bErptxD1jho,5209.199,"up they push her off"
bErptxD1jho,5210.32,"she falls and when she falls what that"
bErptxD1jho,5213.36,"looks like"
bErptxD1jho,5214.239,"is guard this is called the guard you"
bErptxD1jho,5216.239,"guys i am now inside eve's guard"
bErptxD1jho,5218.32,"and what that means is her knees are on"
bErptxD1jho,5219.76,"the outside of my hips before"
bErptxD1jho,5221.84,"i was mounted on eve where my knees were"
bErptxD1jho,5224.239,"around her hips right now"
bErptxD1jho,5225.679,"the advantage i have right now is very"
bErptxD1jho,5227.44,"strong because i have her body trapped"
bErptxD1jho,5229.44,"when i'm inside her guard i'm still on"
bErptxD1jho,5231.679,"top of the fight"
bErptxD1jho,5232.639,"but the advantage is questionable"
bErptxD1jho,5234.239,"because if this person knows jujitsu she"
bErptxD1jho,5236.239,"can actually defeat me there are many"
bErptxD1jho,5238.0,"options she can win the fight with from"
bErptxD1jho,5239.52,"the bottom because i'm inside her guard"
bErptxD1jho,5241.44,"but all of those options are only"
bErptxD1jho,5242.719,"accessible to her"
bErptxD1jho,5243.76,"if she can survive long enough to burn"
bErptxD1jho,5245.76,"my energy i'm going to attack her with"
bErptxD1jho,5247.44,"everything i've got"
bErptxD1jho,5248.4,"and in that process i'm going to burn"
bErptxD1jho,5249.6,"energy if she's alive on the other side"
bErptxD1jho,5251.52,"of that onslaught"
bErptxD1jho,5252.48,"she can defeat me with many techniques"
bErptxD1jho,5254.0,"and options you'll see throughout the"
bErptxD1jho,5255.04,"curriculums"
bErptxD1jho,5255.84,"if she can't survive the initial"
bErptxD1jho,5257.44,"30-second onslaught of strikes in the"
bErptxD1jho,5258.96,"barrage of attacks"
bErptxD1jho,5260.48,"then it doesn't matter how many"
bErptxD1jho,5261.6,"submissions or techniques she knows"
bErptxD1jho,5262.88,"because you're going to get punched and"
bErptxD1jho,5264.08,"knocked out and once you're unconscious"
bErptxD1jho,5265.199,"there's nothing you can do"
bErptxD1jho,5266.32,"so what we want to teach you now is a"
bErptxD1jho,5267.679,"series of techniques that will help you"
bErptxD1jho,5268.88,"survive"
bErptxD1jho,5269.52,"the barrage of punches that will"
bErptxD1jho,5270.719,"inevitably come from an attacker who"
bErptxD1jho,5272.4,"ends up inside your guard"
bErptxD1jho,5274.159,"how they got here there are many"
bErptxD1jho,5275.6,"different ways they could have thrown"
bErptxD1jho,5276.48,"you down and just landed here"
bErptxD1jho,5278.159,"you could have mounted on them and then"
bErptxD1jho,5279.44,"got rolled off the way we just"
bErptxD1jho,5280.719,"demonstrated there's many ways they"
bErptxD1jho,5282.32,"could throw your legs out of the way"
bErptxD1jho,5283.679,"she could turn and put me in the guard"
bErptxD1jho,5285.199,"and she can make this happen on her own"
bErptxD1jho,5286.88,"accord you see"
bErptxD1jho,5287.76,"so she initiated the guard recovery"
bErptxD1jho,5289.36,"there so doesn't matter how we got here"
bErptxD1jho,5290.96,"what matters is that once we get here"
bErptxD1jho,5292.32,"she better know what to do and that's"
bErptxD1jho,5293.92,"the topic for today's discussion or for"
bErptxD1jho,5295.6,"this particular session called the punch"
bErptxD1jho,5296.96,"block series"
bErptxD1jho,5297.84,"okay we're going to talk about it and"
bErptxD1jho,5299.04,"it's several stages of protection"
bErptxD1jho,5300.56,"depending on"
bErptxD1jho,5301.28,"what the person is doing so this is"
bErptxD1jho,5302.48,"stage one"
bErptxD1jho,5303.68,"[Music]"
bErptxD1jho,5304.88,"two four five"
bErptxD1jho,5308.4,"four back to one if i sit up that's"
bErptxD1jho,5311.12,"stage three"
bErptxD1jho,5311.92,"look at this all she's doing throughout"
bErptxD1jho,5313.28,"all this is managing distance"
bErptxD1jho,5314.96,"and therefore managing damage that can"
bErptxD1jho,5317.04,"be done so we're gonna talk to you guys"
bErptxD1jho,5318.159,"about those stages one at a time"
bErptxD1jho,5319.76,"and then we'll do them uh solo with you"
bErptxD1jho,5321.52,"and if you have a partner you can"
bErptxD1jho,5322.32,"practice with your partner as well but"
bErptxD1jho,5323.44,"solo will be very fun to practice these"
bErptxD1jho,5324.719,"ones so stage one"
bErptxD1jho,5326.0,"it means head and arm control which is"
bErptxD1jho,5328.08,"what eve is doing right now"
bErptxD1jho,5329.92,"right there cool so we want head control"
bErptxD1jho,5332.239,"and we want arm control"
bErptxD1jho,5333.44,"and we want legs what's the theme here"
bErptxD1jho,5335.92,"closeness"
bErptxD1jho,5336.719,"okay distance management i want to"
bErptxD1jho,5338.639,"control his distance i need to control"
bErptxD1jho,5340.32,"his head"
bErptxD1jho,5341.12,"i want to control his ability to strike"
bErptxD1jho,5343.36,"with this arm"
bErptxD1jho,5344.639,"and my legs wrapped around his torso"
bErptxD1jho,5346.8,"further"
bErptxD1jho,5347.92,"controls his ability to sit to rear up"
bErptxD1jho,5350.159,"and try to strike so"
bErptxD1jho,5351.44,"head control arm control we call this"
bErptxD1jho,5353.6,"stage one we love stage one"
bErptxD1jho,5355.36,"and i'm just kind of hanging on this"
bErptxD1jho,5356.56,"here the other objective for me"
bErptxD1jho,5358.4,"is to use the least amount of energy"
bErptxD1jho,5360.08,"needed to be able to control distance"
bErptxD1jho,5362.56,"right so i'm just hanging i'm"
bErptxD1jho,5364.159,"controlling and perfect now one thing"
bErptxD1jho,5366.32,"that the attacker might do you guys even"
bErptxD1jho,5367.84,"though stage one is great from a real"
bErptxD1jho,5369.36,"dangerous strike perspective the reality"
bErptxD1jho,5371.679,"is because eve's hugging my neck i do"
bErptxD1jho,5373.84,"have a free arm and if i pull this arm"
bErptxD1jho,5375.36,"to punch her ribs i can do some serious"
bErptxD1jho,5376.88,"damage right here in stage"
bErptxD1jho,5378.0,"one so she can stay in stage one as long"
bErptxD1jho,5379.76,"as i'm reaching for her face she can"
bErptxD1jho,5381.28,"stay close"
bErptxD1jho,5382.0,"she can pull me in tight i'm gonna have"
bErptxD1jho,5383.36,"very limited effectiveness but when i"
bErptxD1jho,5385.04,"rear up with this arm right here watch"
bErptxD1jho,5386.56,"what she's gonna do"
bErptxD1jho,5387.36,"her knee slips right inside and if the"
bErptxD1jho,5390.0,"other side pulls away"
bErptxD1jho,5391.04,"her knee comes in this is called stage"
bErptxD1jho,5392.719,"two so it's a different stage of"
bErptxD1jho,5394.4,"protection based on distance that i've"
bErptxD1jho,5396.08,"created"
bErptxD1jho,5396.639,"and her filling of that space we call it"
bErptxD1jho,5399.199,"filling the space"
bErptxD1jho,5400.239,"so i made space eve's knee filled the"
bErptxD1jho,5402.159,"space and now she's hooking my triceps"
bErptxD1jho,5403.92,"talking about this position right here"
bErptxD1jho,5405.36,"so my forearms are connected"
bErptxD1jho,5407.199,"to my legs so my knees are angled out my"
bErptxD1jho,5409.52,"feet are somewhat close to his hips here"
bErptxD1jho,5411.52,"knees are angled out my forearms are"
bErptxD1jho,5413.199,"connected to my legs and my"
bErptxD1jho,5414.88,"arms are wrapping the back of his"
bErptxD1jho,5416.8,"triceps here with monkey grips"
bErptxD1jho,5418.8,"so he shouldn't be able to come over the"
bErptxD1jho,5420.639,"top her shins are too common"
bErptxD1jho,5423.199,"in in here right it's too i can't really"
bErptxD1jho,5426.08,"can't retract his arm back because of"
bErptxD1jho,5428.0,"this deep hook"
bErptxD1jho,5428.719,"in this connection so it's interesting"
bErptxD1jho,5429.92,"is her arms are not blocking the punch"
bErptxD1jho,5431.6,"her arms are hooking the tricep"
bErptxD1jho,5433.36,"her shins are what's stopping the punch"
bErptxD1jho,5435.44,"and the more i punch with this one the"
bErptxD1jho,5436.96,"more she activates her femur"
bErptxD1jho,5438.4,"and pushes away like that and if i punch"
bErptxD1jho,5440.0,"on this side she activates this leg"
bErptxD1jho,5442.08,"so she's constantly adapting those based"
bErptxD1jho,5444.159,"on the incoming threat"
bErptxD1jho,5445.28,"okay so from here that's called stage"
bErptxD1jho,5446.8,"two and during my attack if i lean"
bErptxD1jho,5448.8,"forward"
bErptxD1jho,5449.28,"she straightens both legs and she lets"
bErptxD1jho,5450.96,"me follow back to stage one so one two"
bErptxD1jho,5453.679,"one one more time"
bErptxD1jho,5454.719,"so head control arm control as i pull"
bErptxD1jho,5456.88,"the body punch her knee slips in the"
bErptxD1jho,5458.96,"hole"
bErptxD1jho,5459.6,"and then she hooks my tricep with a"
bErptxD1jho,5461.28,"spread knee and then if i pull the other"
bErptxD1jho,5463.36,"arm away"
bErptxD1jho,5464.08,"she inserts the knee as well so once"
bErptxD1jho,5465.52,"again we're always feeling the space"
bErptxD1jho,5466.88,"that the attacker"
bErptxD1jho,5467.84,"is creating and now i can't reach her"
bErptxD1jho,5469.28,"face check check and as i lean she"
bErptxD1jho,5471.28,"straightens both legs"
bErptxD1jho,5473.679,"and goes back to stage one okay everyone"
bErptxD1jho,5475.6,"lay down solo with me please right now"
bErptxD1jho,5476.88,"let's do this"
bErptxD1jho,5477.92,"so we're on our back feet crossed right"
bErptxD1jho,5480.719,"here i'm gonna angle for you so you can"
bErptxD1jho,5482.08,"see a little bit better there it is"
bErptxD1jho,5483.12,"right there"
bErptxD1jho,5483.6,"so everyone's feet crossed i want your"
bErptxD1jho,5485.44,"right hand hugging the neck"
bErptxD1jho,5486.719,"and your left hand pinching over the"
bErptxD1jho,5488.719,"person's arm and use your elbow to pinch"
bErptxD1jho,5490.239,"your lat like pinch it into your ribs"
bErptxD1jho,5491.84,"and just kind of stay close but i want"
bErptxD1jho,5493.36,"your knees not here as close and"
bErptxD1jho,5495.199,"comfortable as you can"
bErptxD1jho,5496.159,"so they're almost touching your forearms"
bErptxD1jho,5497.6,"look now let's imagine from here they"
bErptxD1jho,5499.199,"pull a body shot"
bErptxD1jho,5500.719,"on the head hug side on the right on"
bErptxD1jho,5502.159,"your right side they're left what i want"
bErptxD1jho,5503.84,"you to do is uncross your legs"

bErptxD1jho,5507.6,"hug and slide your forearm outside your"
bErptxD1jho,5510.639,"thigh and shin and then take your hand"

bErptxD1jho,5526.56,"and i want your knees to do this femur"
bErptxD1jho,5528.56,"femur like you're riding a bike out"
bErptxD1jho,5530.48,"back extension boom so if they're"
bErptxD1jho,5532.639,"punching here i extend this side"
bErptxD1jho,5534.239,"if they punch here i extend and i roll"
bErptxD1jho,5535.76,"my side slightly"
bErptxD1jho,5537.6,"while that happens roll your body boom"
bErptxD1jho,5540.08,"boom"

bErptxD1jho,5571.28,"i'm posture"
bErptxD1jho,5572.239,"this is very dangerous for eve because i"
bErptxD1jho,5574.4,"can reach her very damagingly"
bErptxD1jho,5576.0,"and she is going to have a tough time"
bErptxD1jho,5577.04,"defending and she doesn't know what to"

bErptxD1jho,5608.48,"cage"
bErptxD1jho,5608.88,"because this is the main point of"
bErptxD1jho,5610.0,"contact and i still can't reach her"
bErptxD1jho,5611.679,"super effective stage three and then as"
bErptxD1jho,5613.12,"i'm attacking"

bErptxD1jho,6343.76,"what i can tell you is because of my"
bErptxD1jho,6345.92,"comfort in closeness"
bErptxD1jho,6348.239,"i can avoid a bite from any position i"
bErptxD1jho,6350.8,"can manage with their biting intentions"
bErptxD1jho,6352.96,"better because i remain pre-frontal"
bErptxD1jho,6355.76,"cortex which means the conscious"
bErptxD1jho,6357.679,"rational decision marketing part of my"
bErptxD1jho,6359.28,"brain is active i'm aware of what i'm"
bErptxD1jho,6360.96,"doing"
bErptxD1jho,6361.36,"i'm not panicking i haven't been"
bErptxD1jho,6363.36,"amygdala hijacked where you're just"
bErptxD1jho,6365.28,"fight or flight and you're just"
bErptxD1jho,6366.159,"panicking and"
bErptxD1jho,6367.44,"trying to stay afloat in the fight so if"
bErptxD1jho,6369.28,"you were to throw me into the pool"
bErptxD1jho,6370.56,"with someone else who doesn't know how"
bErptxD1jho,6371.84,"to swim both of us go in the water"
bErptxD1jho,6373.84,"and that person is trying to bite me"
bErptxD1jho,6375.04,"they're drowning at the same time"
bErptxD1jho,6376.32,"because they don't know how to swim"
bErptxD1jho,6378.0,"when i'm just treading water i'm like"
bErptxD1jho,6379.36,"dude why people bite me i'm like why are"
bErptxD1jho,6380.719,"you biting what's wrong with you bro"
bErptxD1jho,6381.76,"there's nobody"
bErptxD1jho,6382.32,"i can manage that because i know how to"
bErptxD1jho,6383.6,"swim and i'm treading water with my feet"
bErptxD1jho,6385.52,"the same is true in a ground fight"
bErptxD1jho,6386.88,"whoever can tread water and be"
bErptxD1jho,6388.32,"comfortable"
bErptxD1jho,6389.04,"can therefore consciously and"
bErptxD1jho,6390.48,"deliberately address the dirty fighting"
bErptxD1jho,6392.32,"techniques of the other person"
bErptxD1jho,6393.76,"so you'll learn specific techniques but"
bErptxD1jho,6395.44,"this is a much more general question in"
bErptxD1jho,6396.88,"reality"
bErptxD1jho,6397.6,"if you're comfortable in the water you"
bErptxD1jho,6399.199,"can address the additional"
bErptxD1jho,6400.719,"specific threat if you don't know how to"
bErptxD1jho,6402.32,"swim though there's no chance that's"
bErptxD1jho,6403.52,"right and i think the other the other"
bErptxD1jho,6404.88,"overall concept is you address"
bErptxD1jho,6406.719,"the the biggest threat at the time at"
bErptxD1jho,6409.199,"all times"
bErptxD1jho,6409.84,"right so if i'm still afraid of getting"
bErptxD1jho,6412.56,"bit"
bErptxD1jho,6413.04,"that i don't get closeness then guess"
bErptxD1jho,6415.119,"what i'm gonna get knocked out"
bErptxD1jho,6417.199,"so but if i'm close and now there's a"
bErptxD1jho,6419.199,"biting threat now i can do things to"
bErptxD1jho,6421.36,"avoid or to actually create distance if"
bErptxD1jho,6423.36,"their intention is to get close"
bErptxD1jho,6424.88,"i can actually create distance then"
bErptxD1jho,6426.4,"right so we just address"
bErptxD1jho,6428.08,"whatever the largest threat is at the"
bErptxD1jho,6430.0,"moment but we need to know how to and we"
bErptxD1jho,6432.08,"need to learn how to accurately"
bErptxD1jho,6433.52,"prioritize threats"
bErptxD1jho,6434.88,"and just statistically speaking majority"
bErptxD1jho,6438.159,"of"
bErptxD1jho,6438.719,"fights are won by knockouts not by"
bErptxD1jho,6440.96,"biting yeah so if you just look out"
bErptxD1jho,6442.8,"there i mean a bike can't do damage"
bErptxD1jho,6444.4,"you know but to be honest i think i'd"
bErptxD1jho,6446.08,"rather get bit in the arm"
bErptxD1jho,6447.52,"than knocked out punch in the in the"
bErptxD1jho,6449.6,"head 100 so we always have to kind of"
bErptxD1jho,6451.679,"prioritize what the"
bErptxD1jho,6452.8,"what the most imminent threat is and if"
bErptxD1jho,6454.32,"we prioritize those ones and two threats"
bErptxD1jho,6456.639,"then again we put ourselves at the"
bErptxD1jho,6458.48,"nines and tens in terms of the damage"
bErptxD1jho,6459.92,"that can be done absolutely"
bErptxD1jho,6461.76,"excellent you guys so what's crazy when"
bErptxD1jho,6463.44,"we kicked off zoom classes"
bErptxD1jho,6465.04,"formal classes in i think it was uh june"
bErptxD1jho,6468.159,"beginning of june"
bErptxD1jho,6469.44,"we were like okay let's see how this"
bErptxD1jho,6470.96,"goes online at home eighty percent of"
bErptxD1jho,6472.96,"people or more are working solo let's"
bErptxD1jho,6474.96,"see how much progress we can actually"
bErptxD1jho,6476.4,"make"
bErptxD1jho,6476.8,"through this platform and through this"
bErptxD1jho,6478.159,"style of teaching and what's interesting"
bErptxD1jho,6480.719,"is that initially i was like man i don't"
bErptxD1jho,6483.36,"know how much it's gonna be possible how"
bErptxD1jho,6484.4,"much growth they're gonna make well"
bErptxD1jho,6485.36,"first of all from the time that we've"
bErptxD1jho,6486.719,"started the amount of feedback we've"
bErptxD1jho,6487.92,"gotten from people who are doing it"
bErptxD1jho,6489.199,"who are not training because of kovid"
bErptxD1jho,6490.8,"right now their their schools are closed"
bErptxD1jho,6492.48,"wherever they are in the world depends"
bErptxD1jho,6493.76,"what state or what country you're in"
bErptxD1jho,6495.04,"you're either doing jujitsu or you're"
bErptxD1jho,6496.159,"not and even in countries that are open"
bErptxD1jho,6497.679,"if you don't feel safe practicing doing"
bErptxD1jho,6499.52,"jiu jitsu solo at home or with a very"
bErptxD1jho,6501.44,"trusted training partner is really the"
bErptxD1jho,6503.04,"only way to learn right now if you're in"
bErptxD1jho,6504.239,"a compromised"
bErptxD1jho,6505.28,"population and you don't want to be"
bErptxD1jho,6506.4,"around people who are grappling and"
bErptxD1jho,6507.84,"sweating on each other on a regular"
bErptxD1jho,6509.119,"basis"
bErptxD1jho,6509.92,"so we weren't sure but what's crazy is"
bErptxD1jho,6511.84,"this uh"
bErptxD1jho,6513.28,"what i realized is i was invited many of"
bErptxD1jho,6515.36,"you know this many of you don't know"
bErptxD1jho,6516.4,"this i was invited by my friend kelly"
bErptxD1jho,6517.679,"slater the professional"
bErptxD1jho,6518.88,"world champion best surfer of all time i"
bErptxD1jho,6520.8,"was invited by kelly slater to his wave"
bErptxD1jho,6522.719,"pool where he has the perfect wave"
bErptxD1jho,6524.159,"that is generated it's every surfers"
bErptxD1jho,6525.76,"dream on this planet everyone who's on"
bErptxD1jho,6527.36,"the stream knows about it if you've ever"
bErptxD1jho,6528.56,"surfed in your life"
bErptxD1jho,6529.44,"so i was invited by the champ there the"
bErptxD1jho,6531.36,"goat to go to this wave pool and when i"
bErptxD1jho,6532.96,"got there i was catching these waves the"
bErptxD1jho,6534.48,"wave was beautiful"
bErptxD1jho,6535.44,"big barrel and it was the first time in"
bErptxD1jho,6537.119,"my life that i thought i would get"
bErptxD1jho,6538.4,"caught in the barrel"
bErptxD1jho,6539.36,"and be able to get out which is a very"
bErptxD1jho,6540.8,"big deal for surfers because i'm not"
bErptxD1jho,6542.4,"that good i'm like blue belt one stripe"
bErptxD1jho,6544.0,"surfer"
bErptxD1jho,6544.639,"so i'm there and i'm taking these"
bErptxD1jho,6546.4,"monster perfect waves like the best in"
bErptxD1jho,6548.48,"history of mankind"
bErptxD1jho,6549.679,"the best man-made wave which is really"
bErptxD1jho,6551.199,"the perfect wave and i pulled into the"
bErptxD1jho,6552.8,"barrel"
bErptxD1jho,6553.44,"and every time i got in the barrel i was"
bErptxD1jho,6554.8,"going in and i was like i'm gonna do it"
bErptxD1jho,6556.4,"and i was getting hit"
bErptxD1jho,6557.599,"and i would get washing machine and it's"
bErptxD1jho,6559.28,"a concrete floor about four feet deep so"
bErptxD1jho,6561.36,"it sucks when you get tumbled"
bErptxD1jho,6562.719,"you get elbow you get hit it sucks but"
bErptxD1jho,6564.719,"i'm getting washing machine every single"
bErptxD1jho,6566.4,"time"
bErptxD1jho,6566.8,"after the first session in the pool"
bErptxD1jho,6568.159,"kelly who was there who invited me"
bErptxD1jho,6570.0,"said henna come here i want to show you"
bErptxD1jho,6571.679,"something and he got over here like"
bErptxD1jho,6573.44,"stand up in base and here's what he did"
bErptxD1jho,6575.04,"imagine like you're inside the barrel"
bErptxD1jho,6576.159,"get your down low i don't know they're"
bErptxD1jho,6578.0,"perfect but here's what he said he"
bErptxD1jho,6579.44,"looked at my body like this and he said"
bErptxD1jho,6581.119,"the reason why you're falling is because"
bErptxD1jho,6582.96,"turn this way you're going this way down"
bErptxD1jho,6584.32,"the line"
bErptxD1jho,6584.8,"is because you're so bent over the wave"
bErptxD1jho,6586.96,"is hitting here"
bErptxD1jho,6588.159,"and it's pulling you off balance and"
bErptxD1jho,6589.679,"you're falling he said what you need to"
bErptxD1jho,6591.44,"do"
bErptxD1jho,6591.84,"face down the line right here he with my"
bErptxD1jho,6593.599,"body he said this you need to turn this"
bErptxD1jho,6595.199,"back knee facing the front and squat"
bErptxD1jho,6596.719,"down and turn your shoulders facing the"
bErptxD1jho,6598.159,"front now"
bErptxD1jho,6598.88,"the wave is going to go next to your"
bErptxD1jho,6600.239,"hips instead of turn and"
bErptxD1jho,6602.08,"into your hips right here so just by"
bErptxD1jho,6603.92,"taking my hips"
bErptxD1jho,6605.119,"turning me and getting me to squat more"
bErptxD1jho,6607.04,"like this i became a much smaller target"
bErptxD1jho,6609.04,"so i was able to fit in the barrel that"
bErptxD1jho,6611.04,"my big six foot four"
bErptxD1jho,6612.719,"clumpy body wasn't previously fitting in"
bErptxD1jho,6615.199,"so when he made these adjustments on the"
bErptxD1jho,6616.8,"floor there wasn't even a board"
bErptxD1jho,6618.08,"and there wasn't a wave but he just did"
bErptxD1jho,6619.84,"these little you guys the next"
bErptxD1jho,6621.84,"time i went out it's a one-hour session"
bErptxD1jho,6623.36,"an hour apart i caught in the barrel"
bErptxD1jho,6625.28,"perfect barrels for the rest of the day"
bErptxD1jho,6627.44,"and the following day"
bErptxD1jho,6628.8,"and i had never been there in my life"
bErptxD1jho,6630.08,"and what i realized is that for every"
bErptxD1jho,6632.08,"jujitsu technique in the curriculum"
bErptxD1jho,6634.239,"there is partnered practice against a"
bErptxD1jho,6636.0,"resistant opponent for sparring"
bErptxD1jho,6637.599,"but there's also adjustments and"
bErptxD1jho,6639.119,"mechanical body understanding"
bErptxD1jho,6640.8,"that if you don't have that then the"
bErptxD1jho,6642.4,"partnered application is irrelevant"
bErptxD1jho,6644.159,"and what we're finding with our zoom"
bErptxD1jho,6645.52,"classes is that we're having to focus"
bErptxD1jho,6648.08,"more"
bErptxD1jho,6648.639,"on the self-contained and solo"
bErptxD1jho,6651.679,"drills body mechanics and kind of um"
bErptxD1jho,6654.48,"self-reflective"
bErptxD1jho,6655.679,"understanding of the technique in other"
bErptxD1jho,6656.639,"words it's not mattering how you move"
bErptxD1jho,6658.159,"responsive to someone else"
bErptxD1jho,6659.599,"it matters how you move in relation to"
bErptxD1jho,6661.199,"yourself and we're having a chance to"
bErptxD1jho,6663.04,"explore so many details"
bErptxD1jho,6664.32,"so even people who've been training just"
bErptxD1jho,6665.84,"for many years are doing zoom solo and"
bErptxD1jho,6667.84,"saying hunter i've never done this much"
bErptxD1jho,6669.28,"drilling on both sides"
bErptxD1jho,6670.48,"i've never done this much focus on the"
bErptxD1jho,6672.0,"actual self mechanical details"
bErptxD1jho,6674.0,"and as a result i'm getting better and"
bErptxD1jho,6675.679,"we're doing this at home and then"
bErptxD1jho,6676.719,"they've subsequently had a chance to"
bErptxD1jho,6678.0,"train with people"
bErptxD1jho,6679.04,"and they said that their jutsu is"
bErptxD1jho,6680.32,"getting better as a result of the zoom"
bErptxD1jho,6682.159,"practice"
bErptxD1jho,6682.8,"so this was kind of a surprise to us we"
bErptxD1jho,6684.56,"didn't expect that level of possibility"
bErptxD1jho,6686.719,"and we're super stoked and today all of"
bErptxD1jho,6689.04,"our programs exist"
bErptxD1jho,6690.159,"in online form and i can in every single"
bErptxD1jho,6692.48,"one of them you guys look how this works"
bErptxD1jho,6694.4,"so these are the cards for our students"
bErptxD1jho,6696.88,"who are doing zoom right now look at"
bErptxD1jho,6698.4,"this"
bErptxD1jho,6699.199,"so every single program has a"
bErptxD1jho,6703.44,"this is how it works every single"
bErptxD1jho,6704.8,"student has a card for their program"
bErptxD1jho,6706.96,"and these blue check marks indicate"
bErptxD1jho,6709.04,"progress"
bErptxD1jho,6710.08,"with us on zoom for the classes that"
bErptxD1jho,6712.88,"they've done"
bErptxD1jho,6713.679,"so right here is kiona's card and that's"
bErptxD1jho,6716.159,"all her classes you guys i've never met"
bErptxD1jho,6717.679,"her in person"
bErptxD1jho,6718.48,"but she's in every single class and"
bErptxD1jho,6720.08,"she's amazing her and her sister okay"
bErptxD1jho,6722.08,"lisa"
bErptxD1jho,6722.639,"are just superstars and they're learning"
bErptxD1jho,6724.08,"100 and she's almost"
bErptxD1jho,6726.0,"right completing the gracie combatives"
bErptxD1jho,6727.76,"program and here's the whole point"
bErptxD1jho,6729.44,"is that it's a numbered curriculum so"
bErptxD1jho,6730.96,"the way it works is last"
bErptxD1jho,6732.639,"last week we taught lesson number 20"
bErptxD1jho,6734.159,"yesterday on saturday tomorrow is lesson"
bErptxD1jho,6736.239,"number 21 and then 22 and then 23 and"
bErptxD1jho,6738.32,"then it starts over lesson one"
bErptxD1jho,6740.08,"two three four but you don't have to"
bErptxD1jho,6742.08,"complete the curriculum in order"
bErptxD1jho,6743.679,"you can come to all the classes for all"
bErptxD1jho,6745.679,"the beginner programs"
bErptxD1jho,6746.88,"in any order because there's no"
bErptxD1jho,6748.56,"experience necessary to start"
bErptxD1jho,6750.08,"the curriculum at any place in the cycle"
bErptxD1jho,6752.719,"so you just start showing up and getting"
bErptxD1jho,6754.159,"check marks on your card"
bErptxD1jho,6755.44,"and as you complete these the beauty is"
bErptxD1jho,6757.92,"these programs gracie combatives women"
bErptxD1jho,6759.679,"empowered gracie bullyproof are beginner"
bErptxD1jho,6761.599,"programs"
bErptxD1jho,6762.159,"you can learn online with a partner"
bErptxD1jho,6764.48,"already the existing video form but now"
bErptxD1jho,6766.159,"doing it live we can assess you while"
bErptxD1jho,6767.679,"you're doing it we can watch your"
bErptxD1jho,6768.639,"performance we can critique and adjust"
bErptxD1jho,6770.08,"your details"
bErptxD1jho,6770.96,"answer questions and especially if"
bErptxD1jho,6772.719,"you're solo we're showing every move"
bErptxD1jho,6774.48,"solo whereas our video curriculums are"
bErptxD1jho,6776.32,"mainly designed"
bErptxD1jho,6777.199,"for when there's two people working"
bErptxD1jho,6778.32,"together like if you get women in power"
bErptxD1jho,6779.599,"like the dvds or the online course"
bErptxD1jho,6781.52,"in the structured recorded fashion"
bErptxD1jho,6783.28,"that's mainly intended for a partnered"
bErptxD1jho,6785.04,"scenario at home"
bErptxD1jho,6786.159,"whereas the live zoom sessions are"
bErptxD1jho,6787.84,"intended you know if you're solo"
bErptxD1jho,6790.08,"no problem if you have a partner great"
bErptxD1jho,6791.679,"but it's not a requirement and this is"
bErptxD1jho,6793.28,"the first time you've ever taught in"
bErptxD1jho,6794.32,"this fashion"
bErptxD1jho,6795.04,"so these people are all completing these"
bErptxD1jho,6796.4,"programs and the best part is"
bErptxD1jho,6798.08,"once you complete gracie combatants or"
bErptxD1jho,6799.92,"women empowered our women's only program"
bErptxD1jho,6802.159,"separate card separate techniques full"
bErptxD1jho,6804.4,"lineup so we have all these women who"
bErptxD1jho,6806.0,"are going through women empowered and"
bErptxD1jho,6807.36,"earning check marks and we're tracking"
bErptxD1jho,6809.199,"right tracy tracks for every single"
bErptxD1jho,6811.28,"program every single student has their"
bErptxD1jho,6812.96,"own card"
bErptxD1jho,6813.84,"and every card is a separate student's"
bErptxD1jho,6815.84,"progress that we're manually tracking"
bErptxD1jho,6817.84,"so we're watching your way through now"
bErptxD1jho,6819.199,"what happens after all of this someone"
bErptxD1jho,6821.04,"who completes all the lessons"
bErptxD1jho,6822.719,"and develops muscle memory eventually"
bErptxD1jho,6824.88,"will find a partner to practice with"
bErptxD1jho,6826.32,"whether they find it on gracie"
bErptxD1jho,6827.44,"university or in their own house you"
bErptxD1jho,6828.88,"find it online we have a whole"
bErptxD1jho,6830.0,"database of students you get one partner"
bErptxD1jho,6831.84,"you start drilling and developing muscle"
bErptxD1jho,6833.28,"memory you learn them solo"

bErptxD1jho,7568.719,"because we're all in this together and"
bErptxD1jho,7569.92,"the energy is a collaborative group"
bErptxD1jho,7571.28,"energy here"
bErptxD1jho,7572.0,"and the more people that come to class"
bErptxD1jho,7573.119,"the more exciting it is for everyone and"

bErptxD1jho,7576.079,"thank you guys we'll see you in the next"

bErptxD1jho,7594.4,"it's happening right now don't believe"
bErptxD1jho,7596.159,"anybody anybody who's telling you you"
bErptxD1jho,7597.52,"can't learn online"
bErptxD1jho,7598.48,"or you can't learn from home we've been"
bErptxD1jho,7599.599,"hearing it for 12 years now everybody's"
bErptxD1jho,7601.52,"on the online background"
bErptxD1jho,7602.8,"everyone has their own online university"

BEZnDSR9yCo,0.399,"welcome to outdoor defense my name is"
BEZnDSR9yCo,2.159,"nicole and i am here with a"
BEZnDSR9yCo,3.6,"very special guest this is mr donald"
BEZnDSR9yCo,6.399,"hart he is a senior instructor trainer"
BEZnDSR9yCo,8.32,"with impact personal safety"
BEZnDSR9yCo,10.0,"he's been with impact for over 20 years"
BEZnDSR9yCo,11.759,"he's one of the brave men that get into"
BEZnDSR9yCo,13.36,"the fully padded suits"
BEZnDSR9yCo,14.719,"so that us as instructors and students"
BEZnDSR9yCo,16.4,"can strike full force in our realistic"
BEZnDSR9yCo,18.72,"scenarios"
BEZnDSR9yCo,19.52,"he has also been a practitioner of"
BEZnDSR9yCo,21.52,"martial arts for"
BEZnDSR9yCo,22.56,"over 40 years i am here with him today"
BEZnDSR9yCo,25.92,"because i wanted him to address some of"
BEZnDSR9yCo,27.84,"the concerns that"
BEZnDSR9yCo,29.119,"followers and people that have come into"
BEZnDSR9yCo,31.76,"my dms or commented to me in real life"
BEZnDSR9yCo,33.92,"about"
BEZnDSR9yCo,34.559,"if an assailant is wearing a cup"
BEZnDSR9yCo,37.84,"if that is going to prevent an effective"
BEZnDSR9yCo,40.239,"knee strike and i know the answer to"
BEZnDSR9yCo,42.0,"that"
BEZnDSR9yCo,42.399,"but i want to john to address that since"
BEZnDSR9yCo,44.719,"he is a man"
BEZnDSR9yCo,46.0,"and he would be one wearing a cup and he"
BEZnDSR9yCo,47.68,"wears one quite often for class"
BEZnDSR9yCo,51.51,"[Applause]"
BEZnDSR9yCo,53.039,"i figured he would be the expert so don"
BEZnDSR9yCo,54.719,"what do you say to someone"
BEZnDSR9yCo,56.16,"who says well if someone just wears a"
BEZnDSR9yCo,57.84,"cup and they come to attack you then"
BEZnDSR9yCo,59.92,"a knee strike won't work well i'll"
BEZnDSR9yCo,61.92,"address you mentioned"
BEZnDSR9yCo,62.96,"in class when we teach full full strike"
BEZnDSR9yCo,66.32,"self defense"
BEZnDSR9yCo,67.2,"i wear a athletic cup and on top of that"
BEZnDSR9yCo,70.0,"i wear a"
BEZnDSR9yCo,71.2,"five inch foam cup that's specially"
BEZnDSR9yCo,73.04,"designed to take the blows that we're"
BEZnDSR9yCo,74.72,"doing the full force blows"
BEZnDSR9yCo,76.32,"so it's analogous to driving a car if"
BEZnDSR9yCo,79.759,"i'm driving a car without a seat belt"
BEZnDSR9yCo,81.36,"and i get into a crash"
BEZnDSR9yCo,82.479,"i'm gonna get hurt i put on a seat belt"
BEZnDSR9yCo,84.96,"so that if i get in a crash"
BEZnDSR9yCo,86.32,"i'll be protected because i'm wearing a"
BEZnDSR9yCo,87.84,"safety harness but i don't want to get"
BEZnDSR9yCo,89.84,"into a crash"
BEZnDSR9yCo,90.64,"and if i do get in a crash with a seat"
BEZnDSR9yCo,92.159,"belt i am going to get injured"
BEZnDSR9yCo,94.479,"but less if i were not wearing the seat"
BEZnDSR9yCo,97.119,"belt"
BEZnDSR9yCo,97.52,"same with the cup if i'm wearing a cup"
BEZnDSR9yCo,99.6,"and someone hits me full force"
BEZnDSR9yCo,101.2,"in the groin i'm going to be injured i"
BEZnDSR9yCo,103.439,"might not end up in the emergency room"
BEZnDSR9yCo,105.2,"like i would without a cup"
BEZnDSR9yCo,106.64,"but i'm definitely going to be stunned"
BEZnDSR9yCo,108.32,"and it's something i don't want to occur"
BEZnDSR9yCo,110.799,"so to think that you're protected by"
BEZnDSR9yCo,112.72,"wearing a cup"
BEZnDSR9yCo,114.64,"i don't know many people who have"
BEZnDSR9yCo,116.399,"practiced and"
BEZnDSR9yCo,117.759,"said i'm going to give that a try"
BEZnDSR9yCo,119.84,"because they know it's a foolish move"
BEZnDSR9yCo,121.84,"so you would probably not want me to"
BEZnDSR9yCo,124.079,"knee you in the groin right now full"
BEZnDSR9yCo,125.52,"force even though you're wearing a cup"
BEZnDSR9yCo,126.88,"no since i know what it's like to get"
BEZnDSR9yCo,128.879,"need full force with"
BEZnDSR9yCo,130.319,"all my armor on i know what it's like"
BEZnDSR9yCo,140.84,"now"
BEZnDSR9yCo,144.64,"so there you have it the facts around"
BEZnDSR9yCo,147.12,"wearing a cup and grain strikes so groin"
BEZnDSR9yCo,149.2,"strike is still"
BEZnDSR9yCo,150.08,"a very effective strike in self-defense"
BEZnDSR9yCo,152.72,"again self-defense is not about what you"
BEZnDSR9yCo,154.239,"should do it's about what you can do so"
BEZnDSR9yCo,156.08,"for the naysayers out there that try to"
BEZnDSR9yCo,159.519,"instill fear in us by saying that oh"
BEZnDSR9yCo,161.84,"someone can just be wearing a cup and"
BEZnDSR9yCo,163.12,"then that won't be effective"
BEZnDSR9yCo,164.64,"that is not a true statement and um just"
BEZnDSR9yCo,167.44,"know that a groin strike is"
BEZnDSR9yCo,168.879,"effective"
blHAzcQieOM,0.03,"if you've ever wondered what I look like"
blHAzcQieOM,1.469,"the evening after an all-nighter this is"

BlQ8iNJLfyA,50.08,"our purposes the canon of Cataclysm was always "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,kind of questionable. At the time the executive  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,54.4,"producer for 2 said the events "had occurred "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,but just weren't mentioned". Now knowing the events  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,58.56,"of Cataclysm does make some aspects of 2 very "

BlQ8iNJLfyA,the Modern Warfare lobby screams over the radio.  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,905.44,"You can tell both what ship class it is and how "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,they're doing. It makes 2 dropping this aspect  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,909.6,"especially weird considering how much they built "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,off of Cataclysm. Having ship modules that could be  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,913.44,"destroyed or damaged was kind of added here, but "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,2 would refine this idea to a degree that it  ,""

BlQ8iNJLfyA,921.6,"In Cataclysm's case it was just supposed to be an "

BlQ8iNJLfyA,926.16,"so strong and promising that it was released as "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,a standalone game. That seemed like the right call  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,929.92,"with just how differently it plays. The one thing "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,I don't like is just how much more of a process  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,934.16,"capturing enemy ships is. Using your harvesters for "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,it feels awkward and it's a longer ordeal. At the  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,939.04,"same time I get it, because on higher difficulties "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,especially, captured enemy ships can do a lot  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,943.2,"better than your base stuff. These are ships made "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,for fighting compared to whatever the hell is  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,946.8,"happening here. I don't have anything to add in the "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,gameplay front that I haven't said before, so that  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,950.96,"just leaves the story. Well once again Cataclysm "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,came with a gigantic manual. It even expands in  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,956.0,"the lore behind the ships and that darker tone "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,continues. For example, when the frozen colonists  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,960.0,"got to Hiigara a huge portion of them committed "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,suicide since they had lost everything at Kharak.  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,964.4,"Some of these sleepers crew the self-destructing "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,mimic ships. They've already given up hope and feel  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,968.48,"like they have nothing to lose being made into a "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,weapon. Pretty [ __ ]ing grim. You never need to read  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,972.64,"the manual to understand the story, but it does "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,help you understand the depths of just how bad  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,976.48,"things are. There's a lot of details I want to get "

BlQ8iNJLfyA,exterminated. Not every race agreed on this so a  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,1021.68,"compromise was made. The Hiigarans would be crammed aboard sublight transports and sent to the fringe  "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,1026.08,"of the galaxy. If they found a wasteland planet "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,to settle there then good for them and if not  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,1030.24,"tough [ __ ]. The journey took centuries and those "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,who survived were basically feral. When they did  ,""

BlQ8iNJLfyA,civilization. So when the mothership emerged and  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,1039.12,"the Taiidani honey barbecued the planet there "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,was a huge outcry. No one hated the Hiigarans more  ,""
BlQ8iNJLfyA,1043.52,"than the Taiidani but none of them were actually "
BlQ8iNJLfyA,alive to witness the atrocities. The Bentusi, who  ,""

bTyG2KUsNQ4,109.033,"It's not good, but it's not bad either."
bTyG2KUsNQ4,110.68,"Did we really false start"
bTyG2KUsNQ4,twice on third down?,""
bTyG2KUsNQ4,113.06,"And then Dak gets sacked."

c-gc3hJDWyM,23.92,"going to try and keep throwing his leg"
c-gc3hJDWyM,25.84,"over anyway in which case you're going"
c-gc3hJDWyM,27.439,"to want to kind of let yourself stooges"
c-gc3hJDWyM,29.519,"you want to do like molarity and cheese"
c-gc3hJDWyM,31.359,"spinning as i do that so"
c-gc3hJDWyM,33.2,"yeah just like that"
c-gc3hJDWyM,37.12,"if he doesn't know what he's doing he's"
c-gc3hJDWyM,39.2,"going to push that away"
c-gc3hJDWyM,40.32,"and try same thing we need to be a"
c-gc3hJDWyM,42.96,"little faster a little more agile"
c-gc3hJDWyM,44.719,"so same thing in my face"

c-gc3hJDWyM,50.64,"completely out which is really good"
c-gc3hJDWyM,52.719,"that's what i want to work for get"
c-gc3hJDWyM,54.879,"something up here get"
c-gc3hJDWyM,56.48,"get me off of you that's all you're"
c-gc3hJDWyM,57.76,"looking to do you're not looking to do"
c-gc3hJDWyM,58.8,"other anything other than"
c-gc3hJDWyM,60.16,"change my focus getting off of you while"
c-gc3hJDWyM,62.559,"you are seeking an avenue to scoot away"
c-gc3hJDWyM,64.96,"okay realistically"
c-gc3hJDWyM,68.32,"anti-rape you're taking your thumbnail"
c-gc3hJDWyM,71.119,"or the tip of your thumb"
c-gc3hJDWyM,72.72,"ramming it and i'm looking for brain"
c-gc3hJDWyM,74.32,"matter because that's a great scenario"
c-gc3hJDWyM,76.0,"because that's life or death as far as"
c-gc3hJDWyM,77.6,"i'm concerned um"
c-gc3hJDWyM,79.68,"if you can't get to his eye for some"
c-gc3hJDWyM,81.439,"reason he's turned and you can't get it"
c-gc3hJDWyM,83.36,"you can get to his ear ears are"
c-gc3hJDWyM,85.2,"removable i'm just going to attach to"
c-gc3hJDWyM,87.04,"his ear and pull it"
c-gc3hJDWyM,88.24,"because once i attach to his ear i"
c-gc3hJDWyM,90.159,"dropped my thumb and now i've got his"
c-gc3hJDWyM,91.6,"eye"
c-gc3hJDWyM,92.56,"so if you can't get to any vital points"
c-gc3hJDWyM,94.64,"in here you can't turn his head"
c-gc3hJDWyM,96.159,"take his ear if you can't get to his eye"
c-gc3hJDWyM,98.079,"take his ear and then you can get the"
c-gc3hJDWyM,99.52,"eye"
c-gc3hJDWyM,100.24,"let's say for whatever reason um maybe i"
c-gc3hJDWyM,103.119,"hit her she's a little"
c-gc3hJDWyM,104.88,"you know a little woozy or whatever and"
c-gc3hJDWyM,106.72,"it's going to allow me to get to the"
c-gc3hJDWyM,108.079,"mouth"
c-gc3hJDWyM,108.88,"so i'm in here one of the things"
c-gc3hJDWyM,112.32,"talking to a lot of women who've either"
c-gc3hJDWyM,113.92,"found themselves in dangerous scenarios"
c-gc3hJDWyM,116.079,"or worry about dangerous scenarios"
c-gc3hJDWyM,117.68,"you're one of the ones that brought this"
c-gc3hJDWyM,118.88,"up"
c-gc3hJDWyM,119.36,"one of the things that scares them is"
c-gc3hJDWyM,120.88,"being in this situation"
c-gc3hJDWyM,123.119,"and mentally that is scary because you"
c-gc3hJDWyM,126.0,"feel that sort of pinned down but"
c-gc3hJDWyM,128.319,"really analyze this for a second am i"
c-gc3hJDWyM,130.8,"hurting you"
c-gc3hJDWyM,131.44,"in any way i can't i physically can't do"
c-gc3hJDWyM,134.879,"anything to her at this point"
c-gc3hJDWyM,136.16,"all i can do is yell at her um maybe i'm"
c-gc3hJDWyM,139.28,"spitting on her maybe i'm trying to like"
c-gc3hJDWyM,141.04,"you know what's the baby you know bring"
c-gc3hJDWyM,142.319,"my head down and try and like kiss her"
c-gc3hJDWyM,143.68,"or something"
c-gc3hJDWyM,144.4,"but i can't hurt her there's nothing i"
c-gc3hJDWyM,146.319,"can do from this position i have to move"
c-gc3hJDWyM,148.08,"to do anything"
c-gc3hJDWyM,149.04,"so all you want to do at this point is"
c-gc3hJDWyM,151.04,"nothing um"
c-gc3hJDWyM,152.4,"instinctively you're going to try and"
c-gc3hJDWyM,153.68,"push me off but not only my bigger and"
c-gc3hJDWyM,155.76,"stronger i've got gravity on my side"
c-gc3hJDWyM,157.599,"it's never gonna happen so just do what"
c-gc3hJDWyM,159.84,"i said is the uh"
c-gc3hJDWyM,161.04,"walk yeah lock my leg down just like"
c-gc3hJDWyM,162.72,"that because now"
c-gc3hJDWyM,164.4,"i can't pivot and if it's a rape"
c-gc3hJDWyM,166.319,"scenario i"
c-gc3hJDWyM,168.08,"mathematically physically i cannot get"
c-gc3hJDWyM,169.76,"between your legs if your leg is"
c-gc3hJDWyM,171.2,"locked on the outside of my ankle i"
c-gc3hJDWyM,173.28,"can't choke from way back here correct"
c-gc3hJDWyM,175.2,"i've got to be a little close i'm"
c-gc3hJDWyM,176.959,"actually opening the gate for that push"
c-gc3hJDWyM,178.72,"pull"
c-gc3hJDWyM,179.12,"so if she hooks my elbow pulled me down"
c-gc3hJDWyM,181.519,"i'm actually making it easier for her to"
c-gc3hJDWyM,182.959,"get that yeah come inside perfect"
c-gc3hJDWyM,185.28,"so many people come on the outside it"
c-gc3hJDWyM,187.599,"will never happen because all i can do"
c-gc3hJDWyM,188.72,"is raise my elbow and his bandage bears"
c-gc3hJDWyM,190.879,"so right here on this pit you hook boom"

clt1bcfeb2w,550.959,"i need that"
clt1bcfeb2w,552.399,"i have played in two series of last life"
clt1bcfeb2w,555.839,"and third life with this man"
clt1bcfeb2w,558.0,"and you know what there's just there's"
clt1bcfeb2w,559.44,"no point there's just no point trying to"
clt1bcfeb2w,561.92,"get the enchanter back"
clt1bcfeb2w,563.44,"i'm just gonna make another one he will"
clt1bcfeb2w,565.839,"never give it up"
clt1bcfeb2w,567.279,"i'll i'll be forever chasing down that"
clt1bcfeb2w,569.76,"thing okay so what's next the next thing"
clt1bcfeb2w,572.399,"for me is actually to maybe get set up"
clt1bcfeb2w,574.8,"with a wool farm i think that"
clt1bcfeb2w,577.6,"would be a really good idea but i do not"
clt1bcfeb2w,579.68,"have the string for it why do we need"
clt1bcfeb2w,582.88,"wool"
clt1bcfeb2w,584.0,"for a hardcore world"
clt1bcfeb2w,586.32,"well the main reason is actually because"
clt1bcfeb2w,590.48,"i need a lot of beds to do some"
clt1bcfeb2w,592.48,"netherright mining and for beds of"
clt1bcfeb2w,595.36,"course you need wool"
clt1bcfeb2w,597.44,"so we are going to do some heavy wool"
clt1bcfeb2w,600.399,"farming i've got plenty of white wool"
clt1bcfeb2w,602.56,"and i actually spent the time"
clt1bcfeb2w,604.64,"to make a little path that goes up to"
clt1bcfeb2w,607.44,"the top of the mountain"
clt1bcfeb2w,609.76,"one because this is the direction that"
clt1bcfeb2w,611.92,"scars base is"
clt1bcfeb2w,613.44,"and two"
clt1bcfeb2w,614.48,"i think if i'm going to be making a big"
clt1bcfeb2w,617.04,"build it's probably gonna be up there"
clt1bcfeb2w,619.6,"because i'd like to get an elytra and"
clt1bcfeb2w,621.519,"having a high vantage point is a good"
clt1bcfeb2w,623.839,"idea so scar told me that joel's base is"
clt1bcfeb2w,626.88,"over yonder somewhere and i thought we"
clt1bcfeb2w,629.6,"could go and see if we could find it and"
clt1bcfeb2w,631.6,"joel is actually online so maybe we can"
clt1bcfeb2w,634.32,"maybe we can scare him because i have"
clt1bcfeb2w,637.76,"a loyalty trident and they make quite a"
clt1bcfeb2w,640.079,"good noise for scare"
clt1bcfeb2w,641.92,"oh"
clt1bcfeb2w,642.72,"i just"
clt1bcfeb2w,649.24,"[Laughter]"
clt1bcfeb2w,658.48,"that's possibly the most embarrassing"
clt1bcfeb2w,660.88,"thing that's ever happened to me"
clt1bcfeb2w,663.92,"oh minecraft"
clt1bcfeb2w,665.92,"oh my god oh yeah"
clt1bcfeb2w,668.399,"not bad"
clt1bcfeb2w,670.64,"oh dear"
clt1bcfeb2w,672.0,"okay let's see let's see if we can find"
clt1bcfeb2w,674.48,"joel so according to scar joel is just"
clt1bcfeb2w,678.0,"over here"
clt1bcfeb2w,680.24,"hardcore's really got me on edge"
clt1bcfeb2w,683.04,"oh wow"
clt1bcfeb2w,684.32,"okay"
clt1bcfeb2w,685.279,"joel has"
clt1bcfeb2w,686.959,"a really nice looking base"
clt1bcfeb2w,689.36,"don't know where he is"
clt1bcfeb2w,691.36,"oh look he's so organized"
clt1bcfeb2w,694.64,"oh my goodness"
clt1bcfeb2w,697.279,"look how organized he is"
clt1bcfeb2w,700.0,"this uh this somewhat puts me to shame"
clt1bcfeb2w,703.76,"hey he's even he's got a similar farm to"
clt1bcfeb2w,705.839,"me it's like he asked to copy my"
clt1bcfeb2w,708.24,"homework but uh put it in his own words"
clt1bcfeb2w,711.04,"i don't want to ask him in chat because"
clt1bcfeb2w,712.72,"i don't know that he knows i'm online so"
clt1bcfeb2w,715.2,"i never want to waste an opportunity for"
clt1bcfeb2w,717.92,"a little jump scare"
clt1bcfeb2w,720.0,"wandering trader style"
clt1bcfeb2w,722.079,"oh no"
clt1bcfeb2w,723.12,"no"
clt1bcfeb2w,724.48,"get away from the portal i don't have a"
clt1bcfeb2w,726.639,"way back"
clt1bcfeb2w,728.88,"no"
clt1bcfeb2w,733.68,"get out of it now this could be cool"
clt1bcfeb2w,736.399,"well it doesn't look like he's here"
clt1bcfeb2w,738.72,"how did that fire get there did a"
clt1bcfeb2w,740.8,"fireball"
clt1bcfeb2w,742.639,"leave the portal and land here if so"
clt1bcfeb2w,746.079,"that's"
clt1bcfeb2w,747.36,"that's pretty unlikely"
clt1bcfeb2w,749.839,"if we're going to make some significant"
clt1bcfeb2w,751.68,"minecraft progress"
clt1bcfeb2w,753.44,"then we are going to need more ender"
clt1bcfeb2w,755.76,"pearls and i just realized i think you"
clt1bcfeb2w,758.48,"can trade for them"
clt1bcfeb2w,760.399,"i am really really loving"
clt1bcfeb2w,763.12,"joel's base by the way i think i think"
clt1bcfeb2w,765.68,"he is a fantastic builder i love the way"
clt1bcfeb2w,768.0,"he's used copper which is an expensive"
clt1bcfeb2w,770.399,"block for a starter house i think him"
clt1bcfeb2w,772.639,"and scar have something in common"
clt1bcfeb2w,774.72,"very very"
clt1bcfeb2w,776.16,"nice"
clt1bcfeb2w,777.44,"i figure that joel will be back"
clt1bcfeb2w,779.76,"eventually so why don't i just stay up"
clt1bcfeb2w,782.16,"here and see if i can give him the old"
clt1bcfeb2w,784.079,"spookaroo of course it depends what he's"
clt1bcfeb2w,786.48,"up to right now"
clt1bcfeb2w,787.76,"okay can i hit that fish from here"
clt1bcfeb2w,792.16,"yeah"
clt1bcfeb2w,793.279,"i think joel"
clt1bcfeb2w,795.2,"has been uh"
clt1bcfeb2w,796.88,"hunting for netherrite"
clt1bcfeb2w,799.12,"by the looks of things"
clt1bcfeb2w,801.04,"is he still hunting for never right"
clt1bcfeb2w,803.36,"looks like he's using the bed technique"
clt1bcfeb2w,805.2,"which is what i said i was gonna do"
clt1bcfeb2w,807.04,"here's the thing i'm i'm not a hundred"
clt1bcfeb2w,809.04,"percent confident i know how the bed"
clt1bcfeb2w,811.279,"trick works so"
clt1bcfeb2w,814.32,"this could be"
clt1bcfeb2w,815.6,"a very big mistake do you have to put"
clt1bcfeb2w,819.68,"a blast in the way"
clt1bcfeb2w,822.56,"and then just touch the bed"
clt1bcfeb2w,825.199,"or do you hold that"
clt1bcfeb2w,826.8,"and touch no"
clt1bcfeb2w,828.8,"oh"
clt1bcfeb2w,832.399,"yes okay well you survive as long as you"
clt1bcfeb2w,835.04,"put a block there by the looks of things"
clt1bcfeb2w,838.72,"that was terrifying"
clt1bcfeb2w,840.48,"all right let's try this again this is a"
clt1bcfeb2w,842.639,"this is like a one"
clt1bcfeb2w,844.16,"one false move and you die"
clt1bcfeb2w,847.279,"i think i'm gonna get a jump scare every"
clt1bcfeb2w,848.959,"time i do this"
clt1bcfeb2w,851.6,"i don't think my i don't think the"
clt1bcfeb2w,852.639,"shield does anything"
clt1bcfeb2w,856.56,"and there we have it some ancient debris"
clt1bcfeb2w,858.639,"i came down here looking for joel and"
clt1bcfeb2w,860.32,"i've ended up"
clt1bcfeb2w,861.44,"farming netherrite so that's i mean that"
clt1bcfeb2w,863.76,"is a textbook getting distracted very"
clt1bcfeb2w,866.8,"easily and now i've kind of got to see"
clt1bcfeb2w,868.959,"this through oh look at that i've got"
clt1bcfeb2w,872.079,"three"
clt1bcfeb2w,873.04,"hidden in the depths we've done well"
clt1bcfeb2w,875.199,"here"
clt1bcfeb2w,876.16,"that"
clt1bcfeb2w,877.04,"so far is three out of four beds has"
clt1bcfeb2w,879.839,"produced some netherite"
clt1bcfeb2w,881.839,"oh no no no no no no no"
clt1bcfeb2w,884.959,"no way"
clt1bcfeb2w,887.839,"five"
clt1bcfeb2w,889.279,"five beds or six beds five netherites"
clt1bcfeb2w,892.48,"five ancient debris"
clt1bcfeb2w,894.48,"oh"
clt1bcfeb2w,896.399,"it"
clt1bcfeb2w,897.199,"it scares me every time"
clt1bcfeb2w,900.0,"every time without fail i feel like i'm"
clt1bcfeb2w,902.8,"pushing my luck but i have seven"
clt1bcfeb2w,905.199,"which means i think you need four"
clt1bcfeb2w,907.68,"to make a single nether right ingot"
clt1bcfeb2w,910.8,"so i feel like i i only need to push my"
clt1bcfeb2w,913.519,"luck just a little bit more and then"
clt1bcfeb2w,916.079,"we're good to go"
clt1bcfeb2w,918.8,"oh no no no no i didn't put the block i"
clt1bcfeb2w,922.079,"didn't put the block somehow i"
clt1bcfeb2w,924.399,"i misclicked i misclicked"
clt1bcfeb2w,927.839,"i think i was saved by my blast"
clt1bcfeb2w,930.0,"protection helmet"
clt1bcfeb2w,932.399,"i think we're pushing our luck here i"
clt1bcfeb2w,934.48,"think it's time to leave we'll check ah"
clt1bcfeb2w,936.72,"well there you"
clt1bcfeb2w,939.44,"i'm go careless"
clt1bcfeb2w,941.92,"there is"
clt1bcfeb2w,942.959,"there is no way"
clt1bcfeb2w,944.88,"there's no way i'm making it to 100"
clt1bcfeb2w,947.839,"hours when i play like this"
clt1bcfeb2w,950.399,"we are so"
clt1bcfeb2w,952.56,"so lucky okay we got 12. i think is that"
clt1bcfeb2w,955.839,"three near the right ingots okay we're"
clt1bcfeb2w,957.759,"leaving we're leaving that's good enough"
clt1bcfeb2w,960.079,"for me"
clt1bcfeb2w,961.12,"i'm gonna annoy some people by having"
clt1bcfeb2w,963.12,"one bit of diamond left i'll make it the"
clt1bcfeb2w,965.68,"diamond helmet so that it at least looks"
clt1bcfeb2w,968.32,"like a hat"
clt1bcfeb2w,970.0,"oh wow that is that is honestly the most"
clt1bcfeb2w,973.44,"luck i've ever had in the nether farming"
clt1bcfeb2w,976.079,"for for netherright i've never i've"
clt1bcfeb2w,978.56,"never"
clt1bcfeb2w,979.68,"seen luck like that oh i totally forgot"
clt1bcfeb2w,982.8,"we were trying to mess with joel's gone"
clt1bcfeb2w,984.72,"well there that idea goes"

clt1bcfeb2w,1017.36,"then joel's gone"
clt1bcfeb2w,1019.839,"uh"
clt1bcfeb2w,1020.88,"in situations like these you just gotta"

clt1bcfeb2w,1043.36,"would have been the end of the series"
clt1bcfeb2w,1045.6,"now there's ways to do it"

clt1bcfeb2w,1125.28,"minecraft experience"
clt1bcfeb2w,1127.84,"okay well yeah i'm down to kill the end"
clt1bcfeb2w,1129.36,"of dragon um"

clt1bcfeb2w,1143.039,"time to get set up for a dragon kill"
clt1bcfeb2w,1146.64,"i think i've got more than enough to do"
clt1bcfeb2w,1148.96,"that let's make"
clt1bcfeb2w,1151.2,"some eye of ender i'm gonna need more"
clt1bcfeb2w,1153.6,"blaze rods"
clt1bcfeb2w,1155.28,"joel"
clt1bcfeb2w,1156.64,"oh scar she's got he just logged out"
clt1bcfeb2w,1159.12,"she's crazy joel"

clt1bcfeb2w,1164.48,"it was it was looking so good"
clt1bcfeb2w,1167.76,"i was actually"
clt1bcfeb2w,1168.96,"here earlier and i appreciated your uh"
clt1bcfeb2w,1171.679,"your method of spreading it out the"
clt1bcfeb2w,1173.28,"dedication"
clt1bcfeb2w,1174.88,"i just wanted to see how quick it"
clt1bcfeb2w,1176.08,"oxidized so i did a little test uh-huh"
clt1bcfeb2w,1178.24,"yeah sure sure we can already oxidize"
clt1bcfeb2w,1180.24,"everything i'm gonna go and get some"
clt1bcfeb2w,1181.44,"more blaze rods if i come back and that"
clt1bcfeb2w,1183.44,"is this copper forget the dragon thing"
clt1bcfeb2w,1185.6,"i'm going by myself"
clt1bcfeb2w,1187.2,"this is a test"
clt1bcfeb2w,1188.64,"and we're gonna we're gonna see how this"
clt1bcfeb2w,1190.16,"goes"
clt1bcfeb2w,1191.679,"do you think joel's going to pass the"
clt1bcfeb2w,1193.12,"test we have 13 eye of ender"
clt1bcfeb2w,1195.919,"i don't actually know if that's enough"
clt1bcfeb2w,1197.36,"but i i think the max that can be"
clt1bcfeb2w,1198.88,"missing is all of them so it would be"
clt1bcfeb2w,1201.6,"12"
clt1bcfeb2w,1202.559,"and then you have some of them break"
clt1bcfeb2w,1204.08,"when you're trying to find the"
clt1bcfeb2w,1204.96,"stronghold look at me with my minecraft"
clt1bcfeb2w,1207.039,"knowledge"
clt1bcfeb2w,1208.08,"it was a test it was a test and you"
clt1bcfeb2w,1210.0,"passed wait wait wait no you failed"
clt1bcfeb2w,1212.72,"oxidize him nicely that's it"
clt1bcfeb2w,1218.159,"i think you actually passed with that i"
clt1bcfeb2w,1219.76,"was not what i expected"
clt1bcfeb2w,1222.32,"there you go i was just harvesting it"
clt1bcfeb2w,1223.6,"for you it looks nice now okay let's"

clt1bcfeb2w,1235.919,"best yeah do you know what i think i"
clt1bcfeb2w,1238.64,"think we're doing him a favor here"
clt1bcfeb2w,1241.28,"because when i saw him last he stole my"
clt1bcfeb2w,1244.4,"enchanter"
clt1bcfeb2w,1246.159,"out of character i know crazy crazy and"
clt1bcfeb2w,1249.84,"he was rocking unenchanted very damaged"
clt1bcfeb2w,1253.44,"iron armor"
clt1bcfeb2w,1254.88,"oh my gosh oh well all right"
clt1bcfeb2w,1258.88,"it's at my base let's go yeah well i've"

clt1bcfeb2w,1267.84,"good because i've had about five"
clt1bcfeb2w,1269.6,"extremely near misses including one"
clt1bcfeb2w,1271.44,"today where i forgot to put a block in"
clt1bcfeb2w,1272.96,"front of the bed and just nearly"
clt1bcfeb2w,1274.84,"exploded careful you almost lost that"
clt1bcfeb2w,1278.799,"don't fall in"
clt1bcfeb2w,1282.96,"okay now we're cooking"
clt1bcfeb2w,1284.96,"and we got it back"
clt1bcfeb2w,1286.48,"what's the chance of the and the eye of"
clt1bcfeb2w,1288.64,"ender popping"
clt1bcfeb2w,1290.72,"i i don't know"

clt1bcfeb2w,1586.48,"absolutely no boat that's uh that is"
clt1bcfeb2w,1590.159,"rough i might as well try and get a few"

clt1bcfeb2w,1602.24,"there really there's honestly"
clt1bcfeb2w,1605.2,"nothing here"
clt1bcfeb2w,1606.64,"i think at this point"
clt1bcfeb2w,1608.799,"we're so deep into the end"
clt1bcfeb2w,1611.039,"that whether we find an end city or a"
clt1bcfeb2w,1613.919,"gateway well we're gonna have to find a"
clt1bcfeb2w,1615.52,"gateway but if we find a gateway before"
clt1bcfeb2w,1617.36,"we find an end city i'm gonna take the"
clt1bcfeb2w,1619.2,"exit"
clt1bcfeb2w,1620.32,"and just try again another day oh no no"
clt1bcfeb2w,1623.039,"way ah okay"
clt1bcfeb2w,1625.44,"okay"
clt1bcfeb2w,1626.4,"i'm so sick of bridges"
clt1bcfeb2w,1629.2,"oh wow okay there we go we finally found"
clt1bcfeb2w,1633.12,"one and"
clt1bcfeb2w,1634.4,"i don't know how long i've been looking"
clt1bcfeb2w,1636.0,"it's been at least half an hour but i"
clt1bcfeb2w,1637.84,"feel like it's been more like an hour it"
clt1bcfeb2w,1639.679,"feels like a really long time when"
clt1bcfeb2w,1641.039,"you're bridging everywhere okay right"
clt1bcfeb2w,1643.679,"let's do this sensibly make sure we have"
clt1bcfeb2w,1646.159,"bucket on hand we get the elytra and we"
clt1bcfeb2w,1648.88,"skedaddle out of here just need to find"
clt1bcfeb2w,1651.279,"a gateway"
clt1bcfeb2w,1652.48,"this timer in the bottom right hand"
clt1bcfeb2w,1653.919,"corner makes me feel like the world's"
clt1bcfeb2w,1655.44,"worst speed runner and we're in"
clt1bcfeb2w,1658.48,"my ward my"
clt1bcfeb2w,1660.32,"my beautiful"
clt1bcfeb2w,1661.76,"my my lovely"
clt1bcfeb2w,1663.36,"my favorite my my precious"
clt1bcfeb2w,1666.559,"my wings"
clt1bcfeb2w,1669.36,"but it means less when there's a pumpkin"
clt1bcfeb2w,1673.279,"have you ever seen anything so beautiful"
clt1bcfeb2w,1675.6,"in your life we could fly again"
clt1bcfeb2w,1678.32,"okay we've got ourselves enough shulker"
clt1bcfeb2w,1680.24,"shells"
clt1bcfeb2w,1681.279,"i think it's time"
clt1bcfeb2w,1683.44,"to fly on out of here we just need to"
clt1bcfeb2w,1685.919,"find ourselves a gateway"
clt1bcfeb2w,1688.559,"are we honest"
clt1bcfeb2w,1689.84,"i don't see any"
clt1bcfeb2w,1691.84,"okay"
clt1bcfeb2w,1692.72,"we have no rockets"
clt1bcfeb2w,1694.48,"so we need to go as high as physically"
clt1bcfeb2w,1696.32,"possible to get the most out of the"
clt1bcfeb2w,1698.24,"elytra and we need to know that we are"
clt1bcfeb2w,1701.12,"not and i mean not"
clt1bcfeb2w,1703.44,"going to end up flying really slowly"
clt1bcfeb2w,1706.48,"into a void hole so i wouldn't even"
clt1bcfeb2w,1708.559,"attempt to get over that way"
clt1bcfeb2w,1710.96,"so any gateways i didn't see any i came"
clt1bcfeb2w,1714.559,"from that direction as you can see"
clt1bcfeb2w,1716.799,"so i'm guessing we're gonna go this"
clt1bcfeb2w,1718.48,"direction"
clt1bcfeb2w,1719.84,"all right let's see if we can get"
clt1bcfeb2w,1721.2,"anything"
clt1bcfeb2w,1722.399,"no way"
clt1bcfeb2w,1724.399,"is there"
clt1bcfeb2w,1725.679,"a ship here as well"
clt1bcfeb2w,1727.44,"and we're in"
clt1bcfeb2w,1730.72,"yeah yeah yeah yeah"
clt1bcfeb2w,1733.2,"and we're back"
clt1bcfeb2w,1734.96,"oh"
clt1bcfeb2w,1735.919,"okay"
clt1bcfeb2w,1737.44,"20 hours 45 minutes"
clt1bcfeb2w,1740.559,"we did it we did it we did it"
clt1bcfeb2w,1745.039,"and i think"
clt1bcfeb2w,1746.24,"that will have to do for this episode"
clt1bcfeb2w,1748.08,"because"
clt1bcfeb2w,1748.88,"i am absolutely"

ctptIeqAzEY,1.159,"2022 is a huge year for cobra and these"
ctptIeqAzEY,5.759,"brand new drivers have to perform"
ctptIeqAzEY,8.96,"because there's a great deal of pressure"
ctptIeqAzEY,11.44,"let me explain"
ctptIeqAzEY,16.44,"[Music]"
ctptIeqAzEY,22.56,"so why am i saying that well there's two"
ctptIeqAzEY,25.359,"main reasons one of them being bryson"
ctptIeqAzEY,28.24,"deschambeau now currently the longest"
ctptIeqAzEY,31.279,"player on the pga tour who is striving"
ctptIeqAzEY,34.719,"for excellence who is striving for even"
ctptIeqAzEY,37.92,"more distance and will be looking for a"
ctptIeqAzEY,40.16,"driver to do just that and on the flip"
ctptIeqAzEY,42.96,"side another reason is kyle berkshire"
ctptIeqAzEY,46.239,"currently the world's longest driver he"
ctptIeqAzEY,50.64,"now is also going to be looking for a"
ctptIeqAzEY,52.8,"driver that performs for him and they"
ctptIeqAzEY,55.039,"are both players signed by cobra and one"
ctptIeqAzEY,58.719,"last thing to add a little bit more"
ctptIeqAzEY,60.399,"pressure to cobra their market share is"
ctptIeqAzEY,62.96,"currently behind taylormade callaway"
ctptIeqAzEY,66.4,"ping titleist these new drivers have to"
ctptIeqAzEY,71.28,"be really good and spoiler alert"
ctptIeqAzEY,74.56,"they are"
ctptIeqAzEY,75.6,"really good"
ctptIeqAzEY,76.88,"so what are these new drivers that cobra"
ctptIeqAzEY,79.6,"bringing out this year well these are"
ctptIeqAzEY,81.52,"the new"
ctptIeqAzEY,82.479,"ltd"
ctptIeqAzEY,84.24,"x driver lineup ltd standing for longest"
ctptIeqAzEY,88.24,"total distance there's three drivers in"
ctptIeqAzEY,90.88,"the lineup which i've come to why"
ctptIeqAzEY,92.159,"they're all slightly different at the"
ctptIeqAzEY,93.2,"moment but first impressions when i"
ctptIeqAzEY,95.68,"first ever saw these drivers i wasn't"
ctptIeqAzEY,98.159,"blown away by the looks they don't look"
ctptIeqAzEY,102.0,"super modern certainly in a year when"
ctptIeqAzEY,105.28,"you're competing with things like"
ctptIeqAzEY,106.64,"taylormade stealth which obviously looks"
ctptIeqAzEY,108.159,"very different"
ctptIeqAzEY,109.92,"this time looks wise i think they've"
ctptIeqAzEY,112.64,"played it very safe but as you know"
ctptIeqAzEY,116.079,"looks isn't everything with a driver"
ctptIeqAzEY,119.36,"now the three models in the lineup are"
ctptIeqAzEY,122.399,"ltd x max that's the most forgiving"
ctptIeqAzEY,125.92,"model there's a weight also slightly"
ctptIeqAzEY,128.16,"more in the heel to help with you"
ctptIeqAzEY,129.679,"golfers who may lose the shot at"
ctptIeqAzEY,131.2,"slightly to the right"
ctptIeqAzEY,132.8,"that is highest moi it's obviously 460cc"
ctptIeqAzEY,136.64,"head shape and in this test i do hit it"
ctptIeqAzEY,139.68,"but it's not the one that i'm going to"
ctptIeqAzEY,140.8,"focus on mainly because obviously i"
ctptIeqAzEY,142.4,"struggle with the draw anyway so i don't"
ctptIeqAzEY,143.84,"particularly want to hit a drawer driver"
ctptIeqAzEY,145.76,"then next up is the ltd x standard model"
ctptIeqAzEY,149.599,"i think this one is where most golfers"
ctptIeqAzEY,152.319,"are going to be looking if they come to"
ctptIeqAzEY,153.84,"try the cobra drivers the ltd x has a"
ctptIeqAzEY,157.76,"weight position in the back it is a"
ctptIeqAzEY,160.16,"forgiving driver model you can't change"
ctptIeqAzEY,162.56,"the weights or you can do like all your"
ctptIeqAzEY,164.959,"three models you can change the loft"
ctptIeqAzEY,166.56,"sleeve you can go up and down by two"
ctptIeqAzEY,169.04,"degrees and then there is the ltd x"
ctptIeqAzEY,172.64,"l s the low spin model you'll also"
ctptIeqAzEY,176.0,"notice the cobra ltd xls driver i've got"
ctptIeqAzEY,180.159,"here is in the blue finish that's only"
ctptIeqAzEY,182.239,"going to be usa only for europe the rest"
ctptIeqAzEY,185.68,"of the world is going to be the black"
ctptIeqAzEY,187.12,"and gold finish that you'll see in the"
ctptIeqAzEY,189.04,"other two models so what's new with this"
ctptIeqAzEY,191.84,"driver lineup well there's three main"
ctptIeqAzEY,194.4,"stories"
ctptIeqAzEY,195.44,"first one power core cobra have added a"
ctptIeqAzEY,197.92,"weight towards the front of the driver"
ctptIeqAzEY,199.68,"face it's 19 grams and it's a"
ctptIeqAzEY,201.92,"combination of steel and tungsten why"
ctptIeqAzEY,204.239,"they've done that is to offer more ball"
ctptIeqAzEY,206.159,"speed and forgiveness on low strikes and"
ctptIeqAzEY,209.04,"also to keep the spin low on all of the"
ctptIeqAzEY,211.28,"three models the next thing they've done"
ctptIeqAzEY,213.28,"is change the face they're calling it"
ctptIeqAzEY,215.76,"hot face and hot stands for highly"
ctptIeqAzEY,219.76,"optimized"
ctptIeqAzEY,221.04,"topology i'm not sure"
ctptIeqAzEY,223.599,"topology is the correct word you'd want"
ctptIeqAzEY,225.92,"to be using a driver it's almost like a"
ctptIeqAzEY,228.159,"3d mapping system on the back of the"
ctptIeqAzEY,230.4,"head to make 15 spots across the driver"
ctptIeqAzEY,234.48,"face as optimized as possible a little"
ctptIeqAzEY,238.4,"bit like callaway they've used some sort"
ctptIeqAzEY,240.64,"of computer in system to"
ctptIeqAzEY,242.64,"take loads and loads of data from"
ctptIeqAzEY,244.64,"thousands of golf shots and work out how"
ctptIeqAzEY,247.04,"they can make the face thicker and"
ctptIeqAzEY,248.56,"thinner in certain areas to give you"
ctptIeqAzEY,250.0,"more ball speed across the face that's"
ctptIeqAzEY,251.68,"hot face combined with this hot face"
ctptIeqAzEY,254.239,"they've also brought in a new cnc milled"
ctptIeqAzEY,257.359,"face technology you've seen this with"
ctptIeqAzEY,259.68,"cobra over the last few years they use a"
ctptIeqAzEY,261.359,"cnc milling to really fine tune the club"
ctptIeqAzEY,264.16,"face you'll also notice how that cnc"
ctptIeqAzEY,266.72,"infinity face almost wraps around the"
ctptIeqAzEY,269.04,"sole of the golf club again they reckon"
ctptIeqAzEY,271.199,"that's going to make the face even"
ctptIeqAzEY,272.4,"faster and better and the last thing"
ctptIeqAzEY,274.479,"they've done is they've changed the"
ctptIeqAzEY,276.32,"multi-material chasse so now this 30"
ctptIeqAzEY,281.04,"more carbon"
ctptIeqAzEY,282.479,"i must admit if there's ever a year you"
ctptIeqAzEY,284.8,"want to invest in carbon it's this year"
ctptIeqAzEY,287.52,"right now because every driver companies"
ctptIeqAzEY,289.68,"you know using way more carbon it's a"
ctptIeqAzEY,292.24,"material that's lightweight so they can"
ctptIeqAzEY,294.24,"distribute weight around the head to"
ctptIeqAzEY,295.759,"make it more forgiving driver you've"
ctptIeqAzEY,297.52,"heard the story before now because"
ctptIeqAzEY,298.88,"they've used more carbon it means the"
ctptIeqAzEY,300.4,"titanium section of this club the chasse"
ctptIeqAzEY,303.039,"has been enhanced to make it a more"
ctptIeqAzEY,305.12,"stable driver that's the main stories"
ctptIeqAzEY,307.759,"and they're going to retail for 399"
ctptIeqAzEY,309.919,"pounds which is a fair bit cheaper than"
ctptIeqAzEY,312.08,"the taylormade driver this year and a"
ctptIeqAzEY,314.08,"little bit cheaper than the callaway"
ctptIeqAzEY,315.44,"driver and you know i love to talk about"
ctptIeqAzEY,317.6,"a head cover well this year you see the"
ctptIeqAzEY,319.52,"same colorway the white gold and black"
ctptIeqAzEY,321.68,"throughout the head cover and what's"
ctptIeqAzEY,323.759,"interesting though there's no ltdx"
ctptIeqAzEY,325.6,"writing on it at all it's just a plain"
ctptIeqAzEY,327.759,"cobra head cover now with all that being"
ctptIeqAzEY,330.56,"said and done going back to this idea"
ctptIeqAzEY,333.039,"it's called ltd"
ctptIeqAzEY,334.639,"longest total distance as i mentioned"
ctptIeqAzEY,338.32,"they've got two of the longest golfers"
ctptIeqAzEY,341.28,"on the planet are going to be using"
ctptIeqAzEY,343.52,"these drivers"
ctptIeqAzEY,344.96,"so i had to put these to the test the"
ctptIeqAzEY,347.6,"first place i went was onto the golf"
ctptIeqAzEY,349.44,"course i wanted to test the ltdx model"
ctptIeqAzEY,351.919,"and the low spin model as well and i"
ctptIeqAzEY,354.72,"spent a lot of time hitting both drivers"
ctptIeqAzEY,356.639,"now this was my first opportunity to get"
ctptIeqAzEY,359.199,"a real sense of these drivers how they"
ctptIeqAzEY,361.6,"look behind the golf ball how they feel"
ctptIeqAzEY,363.6,"when i hit it what does the ball flight"
ctptIeqAzEY,365.28,"look like i'm not particularly looking"
ctptIeqAzEY,366.56,"at data just yet i'm getting my initial"
ctptIeqAzEY,368.639,"thoughts"
ctptIeqAzEY,369.6,"now my impression on the looks of these"
ctptIeqAzEY,371.919,"drivers as i mentioned before even when"
ctptIeqAzEY,373.919,"i first took them out of the box i just"
ctptIeqAzEY,375.84,"wasn't blown away and similar on the"
ctptIeqAzEY,377.919,"golf course putting them behind the golf"
ctptIeqAzEY,379.52,"ball they didn't strike me as anything"
ctptIeqAzEY,381.759,"massively different to what i've seen in"
ctptIeqAzEY,383.52,"the past"
ctptIeqAzEY,384.72,"nice looking heads yes look good behind"
ctptIeqAzEY,388.08,"the golf ball yes"
ctptIeqAzEY,389.68,"but nothing that would really catch my"
ctptIeqAzEY,391.6,"eye but again looks are very subjective"
ctptIeqAzEY,394.319,"sound and feel of these drivers is where"
ctptIeqAzEY,397.68,"they started to win me over a little bit"
ctptIeqAzEY,399.759,"when i started hitting both of the"
ctptIeqAzEY,401.28,"models and there wasn't a great deal of"
ctptIeqAzEY,403.199,"difference between the sound of the ltdx"
ctptIeqAzEY,405.759,"and the low spin model"
ctptIeqAzEY,407.44,"i was really happy with the sound it"
ctptIeqAzEY,410.08,"really suited my ear i was loving the"
ctptIeqAzEY,412.56,"feel off the face and if i'm honest it"
ctptIeqAzEY,415.52,"took me down memory lane you might"
ctptIeqAzEY,417.52,"remember a few years ago i tested the"
ctptIeqAzEY,419.52,"cobra f9 driver and raved about it"
ctptIeqAzEY,423.52,"when i started hitting these two drivers"
ctptIeqAzEY,425.68,"i got the sense it felt almost the same"
ctptIeqAzEY,428.24,"as the f9 come on sat in a little while"
ctptIeqAzEY,431.52,"but overall very good didn't massively"
ctptIeqAzEY,433.759,"see any favoritism in flights whether it"
ctptIeqAzEY,435.52,"was going more left or right i found"
ctptIeqAzEY,437.52,"actually i was hitting them fairly"
ctptIeqAzEY,439.199,"straight down the fairway or just off"
ctptIeqAzEY,441.199,"slightly right slightly left"
ctptIeqAzEY,443.039,"overall first impressions on performance"
ctptIeqAzEY,446.4,"was very solid but then it was time for"
ctptIeqAzEY,449.599,"the real test as the name suggests this"
ctptIeqAzEY,453.039,"driver is supposedly very long"
ctptIeqAzEY,456.479,"longest total distance on the golf"
ctptIeqAzEY,459.759,"course i saw glimpses that this might be"
ctptIeqAzEY,462.88,"long but it was hard to tell obviously"
ctptIeqAzEY,465.039,"on a wet day in manchester so it's time"
ctptIeqAzEY,467.84,"to set up the tour x with my launch"
ctptIeqAzEY,470.319,"monitor gc quad and pro v1s and smash a"
ctptIeqAzEY,473.84,"load of golf shots and to find out was"
ctptIeqAzEY,475.919,"actually getting some real"
ctptIeqAzEY,477.52,"distance"
ctptIeqAzEY,478.56,"as i mentioned bryce de chambeau and cal"
ctptIeqAzEY,481.52,"berkshire are going to be putting these"
ctptIeqAzEY,483.12,"in the bag potentially and they need"
ctptIeqAzEY,486.16,"long distances"
ctptIeqAzEY,488.08,"so how i started this test i went first"
ctptIeqAzEY,490.319,"off with the max head the one that"
ctptIeqAzEY,492.72,"possibly wouldn't suit me the most i"
ctptIeqAzEY,494.24,"can't imagine this is gonna go super"
ctptIeqAzEY,495.84,"long for me but i wanted to give it a"
ctptIeqAzEY,497.12,"hit to obviously give you guys some idea"
ctptIeqAzEY,499.44,"i found this driver to be forgiving very"
ctptIeqAzEY,502.16,"forgiving and just a touch left biased"
ctptIeqAzEY,505.759,"and not bad for distance but i wasn't"
ctptIeqAzEY,508.16,"particularly measuring it for distance"
ctptIeqAzEY,510.0,"as such"
ctptIeqAzEY,511.28,"sound wise and feel wise very similar to"
ctptIeqAzEY,513.519,"the two models i actually really like"
ctptIeqAzEY,515.279,"that max model i think if you're looking"
ctptIeqAzEY,516.88,"for a driver with most forgiveness that"
ctptIeqAzEY,519.279,"is one that you're definitely going to"
ctptIeqAzEY,520.32,"be checking this year so that's the max"
ctptIeqAzEY,523.519,"driver head done"
ctptIeqAzEY,525.6,"now before i come on to the big dogs the"
ctptIeqAzEY,528.8,"ltdx and the ltdx low spin i wanted to"
ctptIeqAzEY,532.399,"have a little walk down memory lane as i"
ctptIeqAzEY,534.32,"mentioned these drivers"
ctptIeqAzEY,536.0,"really reminded me of one of my favorite"
ctptIeqAzEY,539.04,"drivers ever"
ctptIeqAzEY,541.44,"this"
ctptIeqAzEY,542.32,"the cobra"
ctptIeqAzEY,543.839,"f9"
ctptIeqAzEY,545.76,"i love this driver i honestly believe"
ctptIeqAzEY,548.88,"and it's hard it's easy to kind of"
ctptIeqAzEY,550.72,"reminisce and have fun memories i always"
ctptIeqAzEY,552.56,"think this is one of the best drivers"
ctptIeqAzEY,553.68,"ever made so"
ctptIeqAzEY,555.279,"to compare it i think it was worth"
ctptIeqAzEY,557.2,"hitting this one first so after hitting"
ctptIeqAzEY,559.12,"the cobra f9 it did what it always does"
ctptIeqAzEY,562.32,"for me it performed i was getting 280"
ctptIeqAzEY,565.2,"yards of carry with this"
ctptIeqAzEY,566.959,"301 yards of total distance just 160"
ctptIeqAzEY,570.48,"miles per hour ball speed now swinging"
ctptIeqAzEY,572.0,"it around about 111 miles per hour on"
ctptIeqAzEY,574.48,"average"
ctptIeqAzEY,576.399,"very good like it is it's good it feels"
ctptIeqAzEY,578.56,"good it sounds good it looks good so"
ctptIeqAzEY,580.64,"that's 2019 we're now in 2022"
ctptIeqAzEY,584.48,"what does these two models do how did he"
ctptIeqAzEY,587.44,"differ how much longer do they go"
ctptIeqAzEY,590.72,"compared to f9"
ctptIeqAzEY,592.32,"well let's find out so i started with"
ctptIeqAzEY,594.88,"ltd x first this is the standard model"
ctptIeqAzEY,598.24,"and i was getting on average carry"
ctptIeqAzEY,600.399,"distances"
ctptIeqAzEY,601.92,"of 280"
ctptIeqAzEY,604.56,"yards"
ctptIeqAzEY,605.92,"three yards more than the f9"
ctptIeqAzEY,608.32,"total distance i was getting 304 yards"
ctptIeqAzEY,610.959,"again three yards longer"
ctptIeqAzEY,613.36,"very similar in regards to spin rates"
ctptIeqAzEY,616.72,"very similar in regards to ball speed"
ctptIeqAzEY,619.839,"the only thing i didn't notice slightly"
ctptIeqAzEY,621.519,"different with the ltdx i was swinging"
ctptIeqAzEY,623.68,"it a little bit faster so in theory i"
ctptIeqAzEY,626.32,"was getting slightly less efficiency"
ctptIeqAzEY,628.88,"something to note then moving into the"
ctptIeqAzEY,632.079,"ltdx"
ctptIeqAzEY,633.6,"low spin as i mentioned this has got"
ctptIeqAzEY,636.56,"the potential to go"
ctptIeqAzEY,638.959,"very long"
ctptIeqAzEY,640.16,"did it after hitting it on gc quad"
ctptIeqAzEY,642.8,"well on average"
ctptIeqAzEY,644.48,"i was carrying the ltd"
ctptIeqAzEY,647.36,"xls remember longest total distance"
ctptIeqAzEY,652.88,"i was on average carrying it"
ctptIeqAzEY,657.079,"284 yards"
ctptIeqAzEY,659.36,"one yard longer than this model and four"
ctptIeqAzEY,662.32,"yards longer than what i was getting"
ctptIeqAzEY,663.68,"with f9 total distance i was getting 306"
ctptIeqAzEY,667.2,"yards five yards longer than f9 i was"
ctptIeqAzEY,670.079,"getting 160.8 ball speed very good spin"
ctptIeqAzEY,673.2,"rate around about 2 200 and again"
ctptIeqAzEY,675.6,"similar i was getting on average about"
ctptIeqAzEY,677.959,"113.7 miles per hour club at speed"
ctptIeqAzEY,681.2,"some of the fastest club head speeds"
ctptIeqAzEY,682.48,"have clocked this year they do claim"
ctptIeqAzEY,685.44,"that this is a more aerodynamic head so"
ctptIeqAzEY,688.32,"in theory"
ctptIeqAzEY,689.92,"longest total distance"
ctptIeqAzEY,692.079,"it kind of does stack up it's a good"
ctptIeqAzEY,694.399,"performing driver the argument would be"
ctptIeqAzEY,697.76,"it's five yards a massive improvement in"
ctptIeqAzEY,702.32,"three years well it kind of depends who"
ctptIeqAzEY,704.959,"you ask"
ctptIeqAzEY,706.24,"if you ask that to someone like a bryson"
ctptIeqAzEY,708.56,"or a kyle berkshire they would"
ctptIeqAzEY,710.32,"absolutely snatch your hand off every"
ctptIeqAzEY,712.639,"single yard but for the general golfer"
ctptIeqAzEY,714.8,"they're probably not going to notice a"
ctptIeqAzEY,716.16,"great deal of difference in five yards"
ctptIeqAzEY,719.68,"this year i think these drivers are very"
ctptIeqAzEY,721.519,"good i'm not blown away by the looks i'm"
ctptIeqAzEY,724.24,"not but i think the performance is very"
ctptIeqAzEY,727.36,"solid"

DeedWJatRnU,415.36,"through her passing and like how could"
DeedWJatRnU,417.759,"this"
DeedWJatRnU,418.72,"be part of my journey how how how how"

DeedWJatRnU,475.36,"relate no one would"

DeedWJatRnU,510.8,"doing this"
DeedWJatRnU,512.24,"to inspire her"
DeedWJatRnU,513.919,"or anyone else and it did"
DeedWJatRnU,515.76,"unintentionally"
DeedWJatRnU,517.44,"this is how i get to the path i see it"

DeedWJatRnU,551.2,"most ups and downs and trials and"
DeedWJatRnU,553.76,"tribulations it's like a damn lifetime"
DeedWJatRnU,556.399,"movie and i never once thought about"
DeedWJatRnU,558.48,"stopping until my sister passed and"
DeedWJatRnU,560.72,"through her death"
DeedWJatRnU,563.68,"i realized"
DeedWJatRnU,565.839,"the power"
DeedWJatRnU,567.279,"that i truly hold within myself it's so"
DeedWJatRnU,570.16,"much more than"
DeedWJatRnU,571.76,"a brand and when all the odds are"
DeedWJatRnU,573.76,"stacked against you you get up and you"
DeedWJatRnU,576.08,"go and you do it again and you do it"
DeedWJatRnU,577.68,"again and you let your adversities be"
DeedWJatRnU,579.76,"your why when the girls who have babies"
DeedWJatRnU,582.56,"young and they think okay my life is"
DeedWJatRnU,584.08,"over it's not"
DeedWJatRnU,585.92,"and you get up and you do it for that"
DeedWJatRnU,587.519,"baby i want to be someone that little"
DeedWJatRnU,589.279,"girls can look up to and that my little"
DeedWJatRnU,591.44,"girl and my nieces can look up to"
DeedWJatRnU,593.6,"and look back at it and say like wow you"
DeedWJatRnU,596.0,"did that"
DeedWJatRnU,596.959,"so the vision behind the brand when i"
DeedWJatRnU,599.76,"initially started it was to have"
DeedWJatRnU,601.44,"something good and wholesome found a"
DeedWJatRnU,603.6,"designer to like create like the tech"
DeedWJatRnU,605.839,"packs for me i wanted it to be"
DeedWJatRnU,608.399,"good down to the materials i used"
DeedWJatRnU,611.36,"sustainable i wanted it to be good in"
DeedWJatRnU,613.2,"that sense i wanted to"
DeedWJatRnU,615.44,"contribute the best ways that i could i"
DeedWJatRnU,617.92,"wanted to be"
DeedWJatRnU,619.36,"size inclusive so i have extra small to"
DeedWJatRnU,621.92,"3x i hope to be able to even go up to 6x"
DeedWJatRnU,625.04,"and then i said okay what about colors i"
DeedWJatRnU,627.12,"wanted"
DeedWJatRnU,628.16,"colors that complemented"
DeedWJatRnU,630.48,"the skin tone like the natural hues in"
DeedWJatRnU,632.0,"the skin i wanted it to complement so i"
DeedWJatRnU,633.76,"had custom dyed colors and they said"
DeedWJatRnU,635.76,"okay what if we just do you know three"
DeedWJatRnU,637.76,"colors and i was like well there's so"
DeedWJatRnU,639.279,"many"
DeedWJatRnU,640.24,"variations of skin tone how again can i"
DeedWJatRnU,642.959,"only do three so i did six"
DeedWJatRnU,645.36,"had all my product handmade in los"
DeedWJatRnU,647.839,"angeles california and i felt good about"
DeedWJatRnU,649.92,"that it was way more expensive but"
DeedWJatRnU,652.24,"everyone was being paid a little voyage"
DeedWJatRnU,654.24,"and it felt good that i could go and i"
DeedWJatRnU,656.32,"would oversee and i would talk to the"
DeedWJatRnU,658.32,"factory workers and say like hey do you"
DeedWJatRnU,659.76,"like this it's really cool to see"
DeedWJatRnU,662.32,"it come together that way"
DeedWJatRnU,667.6,"so for the first time visiting"
DeedWJatRnU,669.68,"the factory it's about an hour and a"
DeedWJatRnU,671.68,"half away from here and um"
DeedWJatRnU,675.04,"i've been there like hundreds of times"
DeedWJatRnU,676.88,"now but i think"
DeedWJatRnU,678.48,"i think there's two different first"
DeedWJatRnU,679.839,"times for me i think it's the first time"
DeedWJatRnU,681.6,"i had ever gone"
DeedWJatRnU,683.279,"and um it was to do a fitting so i"
DeedWJatRnU,686.16,"bought a roll of uh fabric my fabric"
DeedWJatRnU,689.92,"right"
DeedWJatRnU,690.64,"took like three four months to get here"
DeedWJatRnU,692.24,"for one single roll and that's how they"
DeedWJatRnU,694.32,"make the samples"
DeedWJatRnU,695.92,"and since my designs and everything are"
DeedWJatRnU,698.16,"custom there's nothing that there's no"
DeedWJatRnU,699.92,"template ready that they can cut out and"
DeedWJatRnU,701.6,"make it to"
DeedWJatRnU,702.64,"so it's a lot of trial and error"
DeedWJatRnU,705.6,"so they use the whole role on trying to"
DeedWJatRnU,708.32,"get these samples right and i remember"
DeedWJatRnU,710.16,"the first time i went when i like my"
DeedWJatRnU,712.399,"right hand guys byron he was trying to"
DeedWJatRnU,714.399,"prepare me like it's not going to be"
DeedWJatRnU,715.76,"perfect and they said yeah i don't"
DeedWJatRnU,717.04,"expect perfection off the first thing"
DeedWJatRnU,719.12,"but it was"
DeedWJatRnU,720.399,"awful the first"
DeedWJatRnU,722.639,"sample"
DeedWJatRnU,723.68,"was"
DeedWJatRnU,724.8,"god awful like the sizing was completely"
DeedWJatRnU,727.92,"off the design was off i remember the"
DeedWJatRnU,730.88,"leggings were bunched like this much at"
DeedWJatRnU,733.68,"the bottom i'm like what the heck like"
DeedWJatRnU,736.16,"it was bad i was like okay"
DeedWJatRnU,738.959,"maybe"
DeedWJatRnU,740.079,"i'm in just a little deeper than i"
DeedWJatRnU,742.56,"thought like so i wanted to do little"
DeedWJatRnU,744.72,"innovative things"
DeedWJatRnU,746.079,"and"
DeedWJatRnU,747.2,"all the top factories in los angeles"
DeedWJatRnU,748.8,"couldn't do it this factory could do it"
DeedWJatRnU,750.56,"but it took five six seven eight"
DeedWJatRnU,753.12,"different uh versions different samples"
DeedWJatRnU,756.0,"just to get the first one right i would"
DeedWJatRnU,758.32,"do the fitting so i have one in my size"
DeedWJatRnU,760.0,"and then i would have a plus size model"
DeedWJatRnU,761.92,"come with me and we would check them"
DeedWJatRnU,763.519,"both at the same time to make sure it"
DeedWJatRnU,765.36,"was right and we would add different"
DeedWJatRnU,767.44,"waistbands were better for the plus size"
DeedWJatRnU,769.04,"models so we would adjust accordingly so"
DeedWJatRnU,771.6,"i got a call they were starting my my"
DeedWJatRnU,774.399,"complete production we had had the"
DeedWJatRnU,776.24,"samples good finalized color samples"
DeedWJatRnU,778.48,"everything finalized quantities paid for"
DeedWJatRnU,781.279,"ready to go so i got a call and they"
DeedWJatRnU,783.12,"said hey if you want to come to the"
DeedWJatRnU,784.839,"factory we're starting your production"
DeedWJatRnU,788.48,"mind you up until this time they only"
DeedWJatRnU,790.56,"send you fabric in black so all my"
DeedWJatRnU,792.399,"samples had been in black"
DeedWJatRnU,794.399,"so"

DeedWJatRnU,802.48,"final"
DeedWJatRnU,803.68,"full sets and i was in awe so i walked"
DeedWJatRnU,806.88,"into the factory and instantly i"
DeedWJatRnU,809.92,"recognized all my custom colors the"
DeedWJatRnU,813.04,"entire factory was like a rainbow of"
DeedWJatRnU,815.12,"just my colors surreal like walking"
DeedWJatRnU,817.519,"through the rose and just seeing all of"
DeedWJatRnU,819.92,"my stuff being like handmade and like"

DeedWJatRnU,824.24,"design on it it was it was amazing i"

DeedWJatRnU,844.399,"was a whole event like if i knew i had"

DGW7eVzulg0,29.34,"joke against the wall is actually a lot"
DGW7eVzulg0,31.619,"better than a choke out in the open"
DGW7eVzulg0,33.54,"choke out me open you can go to the"
DGW7eVzulg0,36.21,"ground very very quickly where the wall"
DGW7eVzulg0,38.239,"will give you some support against going"
DGW7eVzulg0,40.559,"to the ground and that's not where we"
DGW7eVzulg0,41.879,"want to be in women's self-defense the"
DGW7eVzulg0,44.399,"first thing about it choke against the"
DGW7eVzulg0,45.6,"wall is we're going to use our"
DGW7eVzulg0,46.98,"surroundings who wants you to use the"
DGW7eVzulg0,48.809,"wall to help protect yourself and to"
DGW7eVzulg0,51.199,"form the individual always use your"
DGW7eVzulg0,53.969,"surroundings no matter what's around"

DGW7eVzulg0,58.589,"want to get to use that to use it"
DGW7eVzulg0,59.879,"effectively in this particular case"
DGW7eVzulg0,61.92,"we're going to go over it a couple of"
DGW7eVzulg0,63.03,"times and it will break it down choke"
DGW7eVzulg0,65.309,"against the wall here the first thing"
DGW7eVzulg0,66.54,"Kristen's gonna do plain and simple and"
DGW7eVzulg0,68.46,"she wants my face she wants to break my"
DGW7eVzulg0,70.29,"nose she wants my eyes immediately okay"
DGW7eVzulg0,73.44,"now if she can give okay so right now"
DGW7eVzulg0,75.96,"she's reaching inside which has given"
DGW7eVzulg0,77.67,"her shoulder a little room on the inside"
DGW7eVzulg0,79.38,"to break my nose a lot of people when"
DGW7eVzulg0,81.96,"you break their nose their first"
DGW7eVzulg0,83.009,"reaction would be to do this okay which"
DGW7eVzulg0,86.159,"is gonna help us and what we're trying"
DGW7eVzulg0,87.869,"to do but slip them into self-defense"
DGW7eVzulg0,90.03,"mode or self-preservation mode so he's"
DGW7eVzulg0,95.31,"more worried about protecting himself"
DGW7eVzulg0,96.75,"than he is about attacking you any"
DGW7eVzulg0,98.64,"further okay so what Kristen's gonna do"
DGW7eVzulg0,100.829,"the strike she's gonna use is she's"
DGW7eVzulg0,102.03,"going to try to bend my arm in the"
DGW7eVzulg0,103.619,"natural place that it bends with a"
DGW7eVzulg0,105.539,"strong struck she's gonna bring my face"
DGW7eVzulg0,107.789,"in a little closer so that she can"
DGW7eVzulg0,109.92,"strike it okay so when she does that"
DGW7eVzulg0,112.68,"she's gonna hit she's gonna hit the arm"
DGW7eVzulg0,114.359,"as it comes in she's gonna grab my head"
DGW7eVzulg0,116.34,"she's gonna strike me grab my head"
DGW7eVzulg0,118.38,"strike me grab my head she's gonna"
DGW7eVzulg0,120.149,"strike my nose and then grab my head"
DGW7eVzulg0,122.28,"she's gonna then slide down the wall"
DGW7eVzulg0,124.5,"using the wall for balance and slam my"
DGW7eVzulg0,127.53,"head into the wall okay once she"
DGW7eVzulg0,130.679,"accomplishes this she's gonna back up"
DGW7eVzulg0,132.12,"she's gonna strike me several times in"
DGW7eVzulg0,134.07,"the face as I go down then she's going"
DGW7eVzulg0,136.98,"to get me to the"
DGW7eVzulg0,138.22,"okay now you may say why not just"
DGW7eVzulg0,141.67,"sticking to the growing here is led to a"
DGW7eVzulg0,143.44,"part it's an easy target okay this is"
DGW7eVzulg0,146.08,"why we don't keep to the growing in this"
DGW7eVzulg0,147.31,"range if she kicks me to the groin my"
DGW7eVzulg0,149.86,"natural reaction is to spring forward"
DGW7eVzulg0,152.79,"okay give you though any of you guys"
DGW7eVzulg0,155.05,"have been keep them growing you know"
DGW7eVzulg0,156.16,"that's true so if she hits me here and I"
DGW7eVzulg0,158.8,"spring forward I can break her nose"
DGW7eVzulg0,160.96,"where we could collide heads and not"
DGW7eVzulg0,162.97,"correct okay or even worse we talked"
DGW7eVzulg0,166.06,"about beat up against the wall helps you"
DGW7eVzulg0,168.16,"from going to the ground because of the"
DGW7eVzulg0,169.63,"balance and she strikes me growing and"
DGW7eVzulg0,171.58,"it's effective and I go down I could"
DGW7eVzulg0,174.22,"still take her to the ground because and"
DGW7eVzulg0,177.19,"I can also take my time to recover she's"
DGW7eVzulg0,179.41,"not going to go anywhere because I've"
DGW7eVzulg0,180.55,"got her letters okay so that's why we're"
DGW7eVzulg0,182.8,"not going to strike through the growing"
DGW7eVzulg0,183.73,"in this particular situation okay so"
DGW7eVzulg0,185.98,"from here Kristen's primary"
DGW7eVzulg0,187.69,"responsibility is to get to my face in"
DGW7eVzulg0,189.4,"this particular situation let's say I've"
DGW7eVzulg0,191.05,"got her shoulders blocked out she's not"
DGW7eVzulg0,193.03,"able to get to my face and she's gonna"
DGW7eVzulg0,194.47,"use my arms to bring me inside and break"
DGW7eVzulg0,197.41,"my nose hopefully at this point this"
DGW7eVzulg0,199.09,"ends the conflict and she can continue"
DGW7eVzulg0,200.74,"to strike me and escape but if it"
DGW7eVzulg0,203.02,"doesn't she's gonna break my nose grab"
DGW7eVzulg0,204.97,"the back of my head swing me into the"
DGW7eVzulg0,206.8,"wall and then continue striking me"
DGW7eVzulg0,208.96,"several times and go to my growing and"
DGW7eVzulg0,211.0,"skin okay yeah well she's a couple of"
DGW7eVzulg0,214.45,"scenarios they could prevent her from"
DGW7eVzulg0,216.73,"doing this inference that she's not able"
DGW7eVzulg0,219.4,"to strike me here or she's not able to"
DGW7eVzulg0,221.05,"grab my head for instance let's say my"
DGW7eVzulg0,222.61,"arms are too long she's not able to grab"
DGW7eVzulg0,225.22,"the back of my head that's okay she can"
DGW7eVzulg0,226.81,"still do this technique with my clothing"
DGW7eVzulg0,228.43,"okay some s she strikes"
DGW7eVzulg0,230.44,"she has no response she can't get me"
DGW7eVzulg0,232.3,"here she can't get the strike here I"
DGW7eVzulg0,234.64,"push away then she can go and slide down"
DGW7eVzulg0,237.88,"the wall grab my clothing and strike and"
DGW7eVzulg0,240.16,"then after this hopefully that's gonna"
DGW7eVzulg0,242.02,"break me up enough where she can go"
DGW7eVzulg0,243.4,"directly to my head with no problem okay"
DGW7eVzulg0,246.73,"so let's go over one more time"
DGW7eVzulg0,248.79,"we got the choke she's going to strike"
DGW7eVzulg0,251.8,"the armour bring my face in close strike"
DGW7eVzulg0,253.72,"the face slam me into the wall strike"
DGW7eVzulg0,256.57,"several times and then"
DGW7eVzulg0,257.889,"my Roland when she has distance and I"
DGW7eVzulg0,259.689,"can't get a hold of her and then that's"
DGW7eVzulg0,261.789,"gonna be our joke against a wall okay"
DGW7eVzulg0,267.069,"let's show the entire move dynamically"
DGW7eVzulg0,270.009,"so you can see how quick this needs to"
DGW7eVzulg0,271.449,"be done okay there we go thank you for"
DGW7eVzulg0,282.46,"watching our video series keep in mind"

dz-UZx9yrBU,0.03,"now to a Safety Alert this morning we"
dz-UZx9yrBU,2.25,"want to show you how to get away alive"
dz-UZx9yrBU,4.44,"if an attacker ever tries to grab you we"
dz-UZx9yrBU,7.35,"are continuing the conversation this"
dz-UZx9yrBU,9.15,"morning after our story last night"
dz-UZx9yrBU,10.889,"revealed the four mistakes women often"
dz-UZx9yrBU,13.53,"make when someone tries to hurt them and"
dz-UZx9yrBU,15.42,"a tool they can use to increase their"
dz-UZx9yrBU,17.699,"chances of surviving we know many of you"
dz-UZx9yrBU,20.1,"have daughters who are leaving for"
dz-UZx9yrBU,21.449,"college for the first time in just a few"
dz-UZx9yrBU,22.98,"weeks we want to help you defend her"
dz-UZx9yrBU,26.039,"Charlie Moore is joining us this morning"
dz-UZx9yrBU,28.019,"he's a retired US Marshal who teaches"
dz-UZx9yrBU,30.15,"self-defense to women and teenagers he"
dz-UZx9yrBU,32.7,"is here with his his sidekicks so to"
dz-UZx9yrBU,34.86,"speak Jennifer who's going to help us"
dz-UZx9yrBU,36.66,"with this demonstration good morning to"
dz-UZx9yrBU,38.579,"both of you and thank you for being here"
dz-UZx9yrBU,39.899,"I think that this demo is so important I"
dz-UZx9yrBU,42.27,"really just kind of want to get right to"
dz-UZx9yrBU,43.62,"it Charlie thanks for for for showing us"
dz-UZx9yrBU,46.379,"I know that you hear from a lot of moms"
dz-UZx9yrBU,48.539,"and teenagers who are worried about"
dz-UZx9yrBU,50.309,"going away and what-ifs the what is if"
dz-UZx9yrBU,53.16,"we can use Jen as your model so to speak"
dz-UZx9yrBU,55.35,"and and let's start with the first one"
dz-UZx9yrBU,57.0,"so if somebody comes up behind you and"
dz-UZx9yrBU,59.01,"and is trying to put you in a chokehold"
dz-UZx9yrBU,60.96,"base exactly and walk us through what a"
dz-UZx9yrBU,63.27,"woman should do if you will please"
dz-UZx9yrBU,64.769,"absolutely well the first thing we do"
dz-UZx9yrBU,65.85,"generally is to be aware of situation"
dz-UZx9yrBU,67.53,"aware but sometimes you know the"
dz-UZx9yrBU,68.729,"distractions in life things happen so"
dz-UZx9yrBU,70.65,"the first thing if I get my hand around"
dz-UZx9yrBU,71.909,"Jennifer's neck is to turn into the"
dz-UZx9yrBU,74.61,"crook of the elbow and then she has to"
dz-UZx9yrBU,76.439,"put her hands in there like kind of meat"
dz-UZx9yrBU,77.909,"hooks because her first priority is to"
dz-UZx9yrBU,79.68,"breathe and then she makes sure she"
dz-UZx9yrBU,81.63,"doesn't lean too far forward she has a"
dz-UZx9yrBU,83.159,"nice base and then she's going to when"
dz-UZx9yrBU,85.32,"it's time shift to her right and strike"
dz-UZx9yrBU,86.939,"twice or three times whatever it takes"
dz-UZx9yrBU,88.439,"to the groin she steps on her way out"
dz-UZx9yrBU,90.15,"and throws whatever it takes to resolve"
dz-UZx9yrBU,92.4,"the situation and get escaped call"
dz-UZx9yrBU,95.759,"nightmare okay I'd like to show one more"
dz-UZx9yrBU,97.35,"if you wouldn't mind Jennifer before we"
dz-UZx9yrBU,98.82,"actually show it in real time and I"
dz-UZx9yrBU,100.29,"think this is important I would just"
dz-UZx9yrBU,101.4,"want to make sure that no one at home"
dz-UZx9yrBU,102.54,"missed it I think where your chin"
dz-UZx9yrBU,104.729,"placement is because it's easy you could"
dz-UZx9yrBU,106.68,"panic and you're just not what sure what"
dz-UZx9yrBU,109.02,"to do and you've got the carotid artery"
dz-UZx9yrBU,110.61,"here as you showed me during the"
dz-UZx9yrBU,111.869,"demonstration last week and why it's so"
dz-UZx9yrBU,114.21,"important turning that chin is to"
dz-UZx9yrBU,116.009,"breathe if you'll show us actually if"
dz-UZx9yrBU,117.899,"you don't mind so as you mentioned if"
dz-UZx9yrBU,119.85,"she turns her head toward my fingers she"
dz-UZx9yrBU,122.549,"gets into the forearm and where we can"
dz-UZx9yrBU,124.95,"have a choke so she tries and she looks"
dz-UZx9yrBU,127.17,"toward my elbow the crook and she gets"
dz-UZx9yrBU,128.879,"her chin in there too she has to have"
dz-UZx9yrBU,131.039,"obviously the priority is to breathe and"
dz-UZx9yrBU,132.93,"then she gets her fingers"
dz-UZx9yrBU,133.92,"they're to create some more breathing"
dz-UZx9yrBU,135.24,"space and then she must maintain her"
dz-UZx9yrBU,136.95,"balance as we mentioned she steps to the"
dz-UZx9yrBU,138.84,"side to enable access to the pelvic"
dz-UZx9yrBU,140.67,"region or the groin she strikes she'll"
dz-UZx9yrBU,142.65,"step out if necessary some knees and"
dz-UZx9yrBU,146.55,"then to the ground or whatever need be"
dz-UZx9yrBU,148.739,"to escape and I think that what's"
dz-UZx9yrBU,150.09,"important here you're obviously much"
dz-UZx9yrBU,151.38,"bigger and much stronger than she is but"
dz-UZx9yrBU,153.09,"the point is is these little things"
dz-UZx9yrBU,154.62,"turning your chin going for the groin"
dz-UZx9yrBU,156.989,"using your knee the other things that"
dz-UZx9yrBU,158.76,"are kind of hard part of your body to"
dz-UZx9yrBU,160.53,"disable your attacker is most important"
dz-UZx9yrBU,162.3,"correct it's correct because we as you"
dz-UZx9yrBU,163.86,"mentioned we have that threat disparity"
dz-UZx9yrBU,165.42,"you have a bigger more aggressive male"
dz-UZx9yrBU,167.519,"and maybe a smaller female or two or"
dz-UZx9yrBU,169.53,"three males and one male so we have to"
dz-UZx9yrBU,171.51,"even that threat disparity whether it be"
dz-UZx9yrBU,173.19,"tools tactical pen pepper spray Tasers"
dz-UZx9yrBU,176.25,"whatever or tools and Jennifer's using"
dz-UZx9yrBU,178.799,"physical tools so we have to even that"
dz-UZx9yrBU,180.54,"threat disparity so let's let's look at"
dz-UZx9yrBU,182.31,"it real time and then I want to show"
dz-UZx9yrBU,183.48,"what happens if somebody's on topic"
dz-UZx9yrBU,184.89,"absolutely okay and they've practiced"
dz-UZx9yrBU,195.45,"this before so charley is not getting"
dz-UZx9yrBU,197.1,"hurt as much as it pains me as I'm"
dz-UZx9yrBU,198.93,"watching this I wanna help okay so the"
dz-UZx9yrBU,202.98,"other fear and I know that I interviewed"
dz-UZx9yrBU,205.079,"two girls who took your class both of"
dz-UZx9yrBU,207.0,"them 18 on their way they live in st."
dz-UZx9yrBU,209.19,"Simons Island they're on their way to"
dz-UZx9yrBU,210.45,"old miss to go to college for the first"
dz-UZx9yrBU,212.64,"time obviously freshman and one of them"
dz-UZx9yrBU,214.739,"Ellis was most particularly concerned"
dz-UZx9yrBU,216.81,"about somebody being on top of her who's"
dz-UZx9yrBU,218.489,"bigger and stronger if you could demo"
dz-UZx9yrBU,220.41,"what one should do should that happen in"
dz-UZx9yrBU,222.66,"terms of trying to get away sure so as"
dz-UZx9yrBU,226.98,"you mentioned one of the bigger fears is"
dz-UZx9yrBU,228.329,"in the mount position if we call it or"
dz-UZx9yrBU,230.31,"someone on top of you and one of their"
dz-UZx9yrBU,232.17,"other fears was being choked from the"
dz-UZx9yrBU,234.45,"top my fingers into the trachea so again"
dz-UZx9yrBU,236.97,"she must have to have prevent me from"
dz-UZx9yrBU,238.709,"choking were five six seven seconds"
dz-UZx9yrBU,240.93,"she'll pass out from lack of blood"
dz-UZx9yrBU,242.13,"supply to the brain so she must get her"
dz-UZx9yrBU,244.5,"shrug her shoulders bring her chin down"
dz-UZx9yrBU,246.63,"and one of the options is to bring her"
dz-UZx9yrBU,248.22,"arms over the top and then she strikes"
dz-UZx9yrBU,250.2,"down violently to bring like forehead"
dz-UZx9yrBU,251.91,"front and then she goes to the eyes and"
dz-UZx9yrBU,253.95,"then she's gonna rake the head to the"
dz-UZx9yrBU,255.54,"side of bridge and get up and then"
dz-UZx9yrBU,258.06,"strike if necessary and then disengage"
dz-UZx9yrBU,260.76,"and again get to safety all right can we"
dz-UZx9yrBU,263.07,"show you just another time to Charlie"
dz-UZx9yrBU,265.08,"I'm sorry your mic just fell off here"
dz-UZx9yrBU,266.31,"let me help you here"
dz-UZx9yrBU,266.97,"it happened it's on yup no it's just"
dz-UZx9yrBU,269.54,"demonstrate I believe I think it's"
dz-UZx9yrBU,271.5,"important again where the chin is where"
dz-UZx9yrBU,273.24,"the hands are to try to break that"
dz-UZx9yrBU,274.95,"because again charlie is much bigger"
dz-UZx9yrBU,276.57,"than Jennifer but she's still able to"
dz-UZx9yrBU,278.28,"get away so again as you mentioned her"
dz-UZx9yrBU,280.74,"main priority first is to protect her"
dz-UZx9yrBU,282.75,"neck and her breathing she drops or"
dz-UZx9yrBU,285.54,"brings her shoulders up and drops her"
dz-UZx9yrBU,286.95,"chin and then she's going to try to"
dz-UZx9yrBU,288.93,"strike one two three four whatever many"
dz-UZx9yrBU,290.76,"times it takes to get me to relinquish"
dz-UZx9yrBU,292.86,"that and then she's gonna reach up and"
dz-UZx9yrBU,295.11,"grab the eyes and then she's going to"
dz-UZx9yrBU,297.33,"bridge and begin striking if need be"
dz-UZx9yrBU,301.35,"strike get your face the groin whatever"
dz-UZx9yrBU,303.45,"is available to get an facilitate her"
dz-UZx9yrBU,305.7,"escape and the most important part of"
dz-UZx9yrBU,307.35,"course Charlie let me help you get"
dz-UZx9yrBU,308.4,"hopper the most important part also is"
dz-UZx9yrBU,310.77,"for her to get away and is the focus -"
dz-UZx9yrBU,312.75,"of your classes if you could just very"
dz-UZx9yrBU,314.4,"briefly explain to us the kind of"
dz-UZx9yrBU,315.87,"classes that you offer Charlie sure we"
dz-UZx9yrBU,317.52,"offer a wide variety of self defense or"
dz-UZx9yrBU,319.08,"self protection classes but the main"
dz-UZx9yrBU,320.73,"focus of all of them is to avoid the"
dz-UZx9yrBU,322.44,"situation through situational awareness"
dz-UZx9yrBU,323.97,"and being aware of your surroundings and"
dz-UZx9yrBU,326.34,"to avoid those if at all possible and"
dz-UZx9yrBU,328.68,"the next thing would be if there is a"
dz-UZx9yrBU,330.74,"situation so this does that is to create"
dz-UZx9yrBU,333.33,"a physical or verbal barrier between you"
dz-UZx9yrBU,335.31,"and a potential suspect or subject"
dz-UZx9yrBU,337.35,"showing that this is your personal space"
dz-UZx9yrBU,339.3,"and that they shouldn't enter it and"
dz-UZx9yrBU,340.86,"then if need be we have to resolve the"
dz-UZx9yrBU,342.6,"physical tools now your studio is where"
dz-UZx9yrBU,344.34,"you teach this class is out of Brunswick"
dz-UZx9yrBU,346.26,"but I know you travel all over the"
dz-UZx9yrBU,347.61,"country if there are people who are"

dz0HdcIryj4,216.29,"this be real as someone's grabbed you it"
dz0HdcIryj4,218.569,"means you haven't seen them coming okay"
dz0HdcIryj4,220.34,"so let's get straight to the risk reps"
dz0HdcIryj4,221.93,"we're going to go over just some common"
dz0HdcIryj4,223.909,"regrets is multiple different ones and"
dz0HdcIryj4,225.95,"ways to get out of it they don't want to"
dz0HdcIryj4,227.629,"try and be as real as possible what are"
dz0HdcIryj4,229.609,"the risk ropes that are normally used in"
dz0HdcIryj4,231.47,"the street today let's go over the first"
dz0HdcIryj4,233.569,"one the first one is I'm going to use"
dz0HdcIryj4,235.609,"for my part of Victoria this one here"
dz0HdcIryj4,237.409,"this is a scenario from walking past her"
dz0HdcIryj4,240.049,"actually just walking past her I'm going"
dz0HdcIryj4,242.389,"to grab a wrist now as you can see her"
dz0HdcIryj4,245.269,"partner's facing down now Victoria's"
dz0HdcIryj4,248.239,"gonna turn her whole body towards me as"
dz0HdcIryj4,250.579,"she rotates her are at this point this"
dz0HdcIryj4,253.579,"is her at the strongest level and"
dz0HdcIryj4,255.62,"Victoria just tries to use her arm just"
dz0HdcIryj4,257.959,"to turn it it might be a bit hard"
dz0HdcIryj4,259.459,"against the stronger person however if"
dz0HdcIryj4,261.769,"she twists her homeboy towards me at the"
dz0HdcIryj4,263.84,"same time it's much more stronger to"
dz0HdcIryj4,266.51,"release the scrip Detroit's going to do"
dz0HdcIryj4,269.21,"a scissor motion she's going to try and"
dz0HdcIryj4,271.43,"pull out of their way and just pull you"
dz0HdcIryj4,272.96,"out I've still got the wrist now that"
dz0HdcIryj4,275.93,"opposite hand is going to hit my wrist"
dz0HdcIryj4,278.449,"to the opposite direction is a hand go"
dz0HdcIryj4,280.669,"to obstetrician okay this is like a"
dz0HdcIryj4,283.159,"scissor motion listen it again the"
dz0HdcIryj4,285.44,"scissor motion turning bad okay so this"
dz0HdcIryj4,289.01,"the first grab the sick people grab"
dz0HdcIryj4,291.38,"we're going to do is going to be a grip"
dz0HdcIryj4,294.199,"where the power is facing to the side so"
dz0HdcIryj4,296.9,"now the palms facing down should have to"
dz0HdcIryj4,298.849,"rotate like she just did before the"
dz0HdcIryj4,300.62,"previous technique however if the power"
dz0HdcIryj4,304.46,"is facing to the side it's going to be"
dz0HdcIryj4,306.56,"very hard for her to charge the first"
dz0HdcIryj4,308.389,"thing we turn to the fish Sidney Montana"
dz0HdcIryj4,310.789,"so what's going to happen now is the"
dz0HdcIryj4,313.099,"Troy is going to turn to her leave the"
dz0HdcIryj4,315.11,"leg and she's going to bring her thumb"
dz0HdcIryj4,317.93,"over my thumb twisting"
dz0HdcIryj4,319.83,"born in opposite direction okay because"
dz0HdcIryj4,322.05,"the strongest part of a grip is the"
dz0HdcIryj4,323.82,"thumb if we did not have the thumb and"
dz0HdcIryj4,326.1,"wouldn't really be able to grab much so"
dz0HdcIryj4,327.84,"she's going to go against my father okay"
dz0HdcIryj4,330.24,"the great thing about this technique is"
dz0HdcIryj4,332.43,"that when she turns just a little bit"
dz0HdcIryj4,334.35,"not too much rough grab her back and she"
dz0HdcIryj4,336.42,"turns she still has the hammer fist and"
dz0HdcIryj4,339.54,"even if I'm a little bit of time steps"
dz0HdcIryj4,341.19,"you could use it as an elbow so she does"
dz0HdcIryj4,343.29,"have a defense mechanism as she releases"
dz0HdcIryj4,345.45,"from this group technique number three"
dz0HdcIryj4,348.89,"this is the Dhamma hand grab okay this"
dz0HdcIryj4,351.84,"is the only when you pen someone against"
dz0HdcIryj4,353.31,"the Rope at the wall so for this one"
dz0HdcIryj4,356.76,"here I mean this is quite a strong grip"
dz0HdcIryj4,359.28,"so we have to use the body mechanics to"
dz0HdcIryj4,361.56,"get out of it not just relying on that"
dz0HdcIryj4,362.97,"arm strength so Victoria is going to get"
dz0HdcIryj4,365.28,"an output above my forearm by twisting"
dz0HdcIryj4,368.19,"your body and now notice that the elbow"
dz0HdcIryj4,370.29,"is above my forearm there's a bit of"
dz0HdcIryj4,372.09,"pressure on my wrist and she's just"
dz0HdcIryj4,373.83,"going to drop her forward I'm down to"
dz0HdcIryj4,375.27,"her head okay and this is going to be"
dz0HdcIryj4,377.64,"the same on the other side you cannot do"
dz0HdcIryj4,381.69,"them both at the same time try dropping"
dz0HdcIryj4,383.43,"for the same time if you don't have the"
dz0HdcIryj4,385.38,"body rotation okay so you release one"
dz0HdcIryj4,388.02,"and then if I'm too strong should be"
dz0HdcIryj4,390.72,"always hammer first me with them a hand"
dz0HdcIryj4,392.34,"to disrupt me while she releases the"
dz0HdcIryj4,394.41,"other one and then to create the"
dz0HdcIryj4,396.15,"distance and to get exits if you came"
dz0HdcIryj4,398.49,"the wrist grab TV number four closed"
dz0HdcIryj4,400.47,"syllables in the previous ones where"
dz0HdcIryj4,402.42,"it's just the one handed grab so instead"
dz0HdcIryj4,404.79,"of me using one hand two hands there"
dz0HdcIryj4,407.22,"normally when I grab someone's wrist"
dz0HdcIryj4,408.87,"there's one a few things I'm going to do"
dz0HdcIryj4,410.22,"what I'm going to pull them closer so I"
dz0HdcIryj4,412.26,"could read them to maybe I want to get"
dz0HdcIryj4,415.02,"their attention so I could strike them"
dz0HdcIryj4,416.67,"or maybe stab them okay"
dz0HdcIryj4,418.56,"all three I'm trying to drink them all"
dz0HdcIryj4,420.48,"somewhere now the three reasons normally"
dz0HdcIryj4,423.69,"why someone grab you and also to stop"
dz0HdcIryj4,426.42,"them trying to hit you but in the day"
dz0HdcIryj4,428.25,"we've been the defenders here not the"
dz0HdcIryj4,430.32,"attackers so tip number four is if I got"
dz0HdcIryj4,433.8,"both hands on and the most important"
dz0HdcIryj4,435.99,"thing is from trying to do is don't give"
dz0HdcIryj4,437.76,"me the report will it be poor girl she's"
dz0HdcIryj4,439.71,"going to grab yourself and be heavy so"
dz0HdcIryj4,441.54,"for me getting tropone is much more"
dz0HdcIryj4,443.13,"harder because inundation what's going"
dz0HdcIryj4,445.14,"to work for"
dz0HdcIryj4,445.68,"she makes it first and what's going to"
dz0HdcIryj4,447.78,"happen to grab that pulled out by"
dz0HdcIryj4,449.16,"trusting the body now notice that she"
dz0HdcIryj4,451.29,"could still use a hammer first that she"
dz0HdcIryj4,452.82,"needs to or they are going to pendant on"
dz0HdcIryj4,455.07,"the range and also from the previous"
dz0HdcIryj4,457.59,"episodes when we did the sidekick she"
dz0HdcIryj4,459.99,"could psychic my leg as she exited out"
dz0HdcIryj4,462.09,"to get away okay so this is one point of"
dz0HdcIryj4,465.57,"order to give author strikes on episodes"
dz0HdcIryj4,467.52,"the previous few episodes so hope you"
dz0HdcIryj4,470.07,"enjoyed that and I don't afford to see"
dz0HdcIryj4,471.36,"the next one"
e5cnGhq-LPU,0.08,"and so"
e5cnGhq-LPU,1.599,"if i'm grabbing both hands his elbow is"
e5cnGhq-LPU,3.04,"going to push down against her body"
e5cnGhq-LPU,4.48,"basically i can't let go with his hand"
e5cnGhq-LPU,5.92,"it's strapped there okay now do it again"
e5cnGhq-LPU,8.08,"slow"
e5cnGhq-LPU,9.12,"she's going to make sure the elbow is"
e5cnGhq-LPU,10.4,"bent"
e5cnGhq-LPU,12.4,"and she's going to push her hand to the"
e5cnGhq-LPU,14.719,"side of her ear and she's going to push"
e5cnGhq-LPU,16.48,"up on her hip see my hips right here"
e5cnGhq-LPU,18.4,"okay i'm going to just tip my hip"
e5cnGhq-LPU,23.119,"okay"
e5cnGhq-LPU,24.0,"okay so if that same thing we're doing"
e5cnGhq-LPU,26.0,"we're flying up in the air i'm just"
e5cnGhq-LPU,27.439,"taking this hip and putting it into the"
e5cnGhq-LPU,34.239,"okay"
e5cnGhq-LPU,36.0,"same thing what she's going to do is"
e5cnGhq-LPU,38.32,"both wrists"
e5cnGhq-LPU,39.84,"both wrists are being held down"
e5cnGhq-LPU,42.079,"because she got a third person who's"
e5cnGhq-LPU,43.44,"tickling her"
e5cnGhq-LPU,44.399,"this is the straight up mm-hmm okay"
e5cnGhq-LPU,47.68,"turn my head"
e5cnGhq-LPU,49.44,"go ahead and go and do it at speed and"
e5cnGhq-LPU,50.8,"let people see"
e5cnGhq-LPU,52.0,"i'm just gonna shoot"
e5cnGhq-LPU,53.44,"and then wrap"
e5cnGhq-LPU,54.8,"and then"
e5cnGhq-LPU,63.039,"if someone's holding you down their body"
e5cnGhq-LPU,64.479,"weight isn't going to center it's"
e5cnGhq-LPU,65.519,"actually going to be around here at her"
e5cnGhq-LPU,66.799,"wrist"
e5cnGhq-LPU,67.84,"so he's on that weight is all up here on"
e5cnGhq-LPU,70.32,"my so how is he push up so she's"
e5cnGhq-LPU,73.04,"basically raising her both of her hands"
e5cnGhq-LPU,75.52,"and when it happens i'm so fine i still"
e5cnGhq-LPU,77.36,"got her but now she's going to make a"
e5cnGhq-LPU,78.799,"big snow angel"
e5cnGhq-LPU,83.36,"when it happens pretty much my arms are"
e5cnGhq-LPU,84.799,"right back here one hand is just going"
e5cnGhq-LPU,86.88,"to come to my on my leg the other one is"
e5cnGhq-LPU,88.96,"going to help push up as she pushes up"
e5cnGhq-LPU,90.479,"with your hips"
e5cnGhq-LPU,92.079,"yes"
e5cnGhq-LPU,93.2,"okay okay"
e5cnGhq-LPU,94.799,"if you do it quick enough as i turn my"
e5cnGhq-LPU,96.88,"head the face just hits the tree you"
e5cnGhq-LPU,98.64,"have to turn your head so i don't run"
e5cnGhq-LPU,100.64,"into you okay last time"
e5cnGhq-LPU,104.88,"so"
e5cnGhq-LPU,106.079,"i'm going to do this"
e5cnGhq-LPU,107.52,"straight up"
e5cnGhq-LPU,108.799,"shoot straight up and then drop back"
e5cnGhq-LPU,111.759,"and then grab here and most of it is"
e5cnGhq-LPU,114.799,"just a transfer of weight yeah to get"
e5cnGhq-LPU,117.84,"them off for you"
e5cnGhq-LPU,119.119,"most of it remember it is that fact that"
e5cnGhq-LPU,121.84,"the weight is up here"
e5cnGhq-LPU,123.759,"so as it moves as you move it out and it"
e5cnGhq-LPU,126.399,"doesn't make you"
e5cnGhq-LPU,139.76,"shoot it up"

Eh-BoCwTX_A,14.08,"straight punching or the shooting"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,15.25,"fingers so I grabbed onto a risk she"

Eh-BoCwTX_A,22.36,"line if I'm squeezing on her neck here"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,25.419,"if she brings her arms inside line and"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,28.15,"creates a structure now the harder I"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,30.22,"squeeze on her neck the harder I'm"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,32.11,"choking my own self because of the"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,34.18,"structure here and then she can put her"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,36.55,"thumbs right in here to that soft spot"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,38.17,"and and doesn't make me want to continue"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,40.719,"standing here rear choke position yet is"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,44.079,"going to start using some more advanced"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,45.399,"techniques advanced body mechanics to"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,47.829,"break my structure to enable her to"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,50.62,"throw me so I get a choke position on"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,53.59,"her you're going to do her good just"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,58.3,"like that and she can follow up with"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,59.739,"whatever kind of strikes she wants or"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,61.629,"she can take off the front pole mount"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,64.059,"position which is a very strong position"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,65.77,"for me a very bad position for her to be"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,68.41,"in but even though I'm bigger and"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,70.57,"stronger and I have the best position if"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,73.0,"she spent some time training these"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,75.52,"techniques she will actually be able to"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,77.59,"escape out of this position so I have"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,80.229,"her in this position might be grabbing"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,81.64,"her might be choking her she could ahead"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,83.259,"miss her technique and that's perfect I"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,92.229,"think it's important for women to"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,93.67,"realize that it's okay for them to say"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,95.86,"no or to say stop in a situation where"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,98.89,"they feel like they're being victimized"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,100.39,"or something is uncomfortable the"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,102.969,"reality is the situation is probably not"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,105.88,"going to be some boogie man jumping out"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,107.86,"of the bushes grabbing them although"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,110.259,"that does occasionally happen most"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,112.96,"situations I think where women are"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,115.409,"needing to defend themselves physically"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,117.729,"where they might be being victimized"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,119.789,"happens with someone that's maybe a"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,122.079,"family friend maybe it's a good friend"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,125.799,"of their brothers it could be an uncle"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,127.78,"or it can be some sort of acquaintance"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,129.64,"somebody they know and they need to know"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,131.38,"that it's okay to say stop and"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,133.47,"be assertive even if it's somebody they"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,135.9,"know that it's still okay to say no and"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,137.97,"stop regardless of who this person is"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,140.97,"and then beyond that if the person"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,143.34,"continues to try to victimize them or"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,146.67,"grab them or touch them or do something"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,149.19,"inappropriate and the the female has"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,151.53,"said stop no stop and the person is"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,154.29,"continuing to grab them it's okay to"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,155.79,"physically defend themselves even if"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,157.62,"this is someone that they know or that's"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,159.54,"a friend that when they say no they mean"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,162.0,"it it's okay to be assertive and defend"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,163.8,"themselves physically and so that's"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,165.66,"where we started getting into some of"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,167.07,"our physical techniques we covered today"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,168.54,"and as I mentioned it are at our seminar"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,172.08,"I think it's real important for women to"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,173.459,"realize where they come to a seminar for"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,176.16,"a few hours on a weekend it's more of"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,178.83,"like a showcase showing them"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,180.62,"demonstrating to them different"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,182.25,"techniques that are available but for"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,185.43,"them to not have some sort of false"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,186.87,"sense of security they need to realize"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,188.61,"they're not going to be able to pull"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,190.53,"these maneuvers off in a real situation"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,192.57,"in a stressful situation if they haven't"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,195.72,"been drilling and training those"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,197.37,"techniques over and over so this is an"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,199.38,"opportunity to showcase to them some of"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,201.18,"the material that's available and then"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,203.1,"if they're interested in serious about"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,205.29,"learning these techniques and getting"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,206.7,"them down for real then they should join"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,208.59,"some sort of program a self-defense"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,210.6,"class at least a cardio kickboxing class"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,213.48,"something where they can start"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,215.16,"practicing some of these techniques and"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,216.81,"drills with numerous repetitions so that"
Eh-BoCwTX_A,219.57,"they can become reaction and they'll be"

Eh0GQdNqmZ0,88.5,"into that situation."

Eh0GQdNqmZ0,talk about the difference,""
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,762.94,"between fear and anger."

Eh0GQdNqmZ0,806.62,"- (growls)"
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,- Yeah, like that,,""
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,809.08,"like not an unreasonable"

Eh0GQdNqmZ0,837.44,"(rock music)"
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,849.06,"- All right, so."
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,850.32,"What's super important"
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,when we learn self-defence,""
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,853.5,"is to keep ourselves safe to begin with."
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,855.7,"If you've learned the"
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,safe way to do techniques,,""

Eh0GQdNqmZ0,886.16,"I sometimes call them "chicken bones","

Eh0GQdNqmZ0,it makes it really hard.,""

Eh0GQdNqmZ0,891.22,"- For now what I want you to do"
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,892.9,"is just stand in a very"

Eh0GQdNqmZ0,894.9,"take up more space than"
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,you feel that you should.,""
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,897.7,"Part of self-defence is kind"
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,of reclaiming that space,,""
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,900.42,"so you can take up as"
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,much space as you want.,""

Eh0GQdNqmZ0,home, late at night.,""
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,903.36,"- Yeah. (laughter)"
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,905.8,"And what we're doing is"
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,we're pointing our toes,""

Eh0GQdNqmZ0,right up between their legs,,""
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,910.72,"right up into the testicles."

Eh0GQdNqmZ0,917.02,"turning that fear into anger and yelling,"
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,918.86,"what I think it'd be fun"
Eh0GQdNqmZ0,to yell, in this case,,""

EWIPLzuXlek,1004.91,"character affect you as an actor but"
EWIPLzuXlek,1007.43,"also as a male well I mean as an actor"
EWIPLzuXlek,1010.07,"it was certainly a stretch for me"
EWIPLzuXlek,1012.59,"because it was very different for my own"
EWIPLzuXlek,1015.08,"personality yeah and but as a male more"
EWIPLzuXlek,1019.76,"strongly it made me aware what how a"
EWIPLzuXlek,1022.76,"male dominance could change a woman's"
EWIPLzuXlek,1024.53,"life you know through the abusing and"
EWIPLzuXlek,1026.63,"through the violence not only"
EWIPLzuXlek,1029.03,"domestically but psychologically it just"
EWIPLzuXlek,1032.12,"goes on everywhere that's that's a good"
EWIPLzuXlek,1034.88,"point yeah Mary let me ask you the same"
EWIPLzuXlek,1037.52,"question how did this character affect"
EWIPLzuXlek,1039.26,"you as an actress but also as a female"
EWIPLzuXlek,1041.87,"as a female is the thing that that"
EWIPLzuXlek,1045.29,"really comes to mind because I've known"
EWIPLzuXlek,1048.29,"so many women that really don't think"
EWIPLzuXlek,1051.62,"they can do anything about it yeah and"
EWIPLzuXlek,1054.14,"that's the thing that really comes"
EWIPLzuXlek,1056.3,"through to me there are things that I"
EWIPLzuXlek,1058.19,"can do even if I'm not a wrestler like"
EWIPLzuXlek,1060.95,"you are there are things that I can"
EWIPLzuXlek,1063.15,"do to help myself and that for you"
EWIPLzuXlek,1065.67,"that's good that's definitely right let"
EWIPLzuXlek,1068.43,"me ask you another question Mary how do"
EWIPLzuXlek,1071.04,"you think this female self-defense show"
EWIPLzuXlek,1073.32,"can help other people and what kind of"
EWIPLzuXlek,1076.2,"advice would you give the viewers well"
EWIPLzuXlek,1078.9,"you know there was one thing that we"
EWIPLzuXlek,1080.46,"worked out when we were shooting on the"
EWIPLzuXlek,1082.74,"purse snatch that I would like to say to"
EWIPLzuXlek,1085.53,"women out there initially we were going"
EWIPLzuXlek,1088.71,"to shoot this with me wearing a skirt"
EWIPLzuXlek,1091.08,"and it was difficult for me to defend"
EWIPLzuXlek,1094.29,"myself wearing a skirt so one thing I've"
EWIPLzuXlek,1097.32,"learned is if I'm walking out to the"
EWIPLzuXlek,1099.51,"grocery store wear slacks ladies because"
EWIPLzuXlek,1102.3,"if you have to defend yourself it will"
EWIPLzuXlek,1104.79,"be a lot easier for you to do great"
EWIPLzuXlek,1106.92,"point"
EWIPLzuXlek,1107.37,"really good point Mary really good right"
EWIPLzuXlek,1111.09,"do you know how about yourself how do"
EWIPLzuXlek,1113.61,"you think that this female self defends"
EWIPLzuXlek,1115.83,"show can help other people and what kind"
EWIPLzuXlek,1118.92,"of advice do you give the audience well"
EWIPLzuXlek,1121.23,"it's not for me to relate to the whole"
EWIPLzuXlek,1122.85,"thing because as I said it's very"
EWIPLzuXlek,1124.2,"different from my own perspective but"
EWIPLzuXlek,1126.66,"the advice I would give the ladies out"
EWIPLzuXlek,1128.94,"there is to stop it before it's too late"
EWIPLzuXlek,1132.15,"you know when it can get too violent and"
EWIPLzuXlek,1134.55,"when it comes to a point when the woman"
EWIPLzuXlek,1138.87,"can't stop it and she just has to"
EWIPLzuXlek,1140.52,"continue being abused and being you know"
EWIPLzuXlek,1142.61,"violated in this way so I know it takes"
EWIPLzuXlek,1145.71,"a lot of strength a lot of inner"
EWIPLzuXlek,1146.94,"strength you know but that strength has"
EWIPLzuXlek,1149.22,"to be conjured up yes and brought out to"
EWIPLzuXlek,1152.28,"the open and stop it before working at"
EWIPLzuXlek,1154.83,"too late so your advice to the audience"
EWIPLzuXlek,1156.78,"would be to prevent it to prevent it"
EWIPLzuXlek,1160.32,"before it gets to the point where he"
EWIPLzuXlek,1161.79,"can't be prevented that's very good"
EWIPLzuXlek,1164.07,"definitely I'm bring that inner strength"
EWIPLzuXlek,1165.51,"from insight you know absolutely one"
EWIPLzuXlek,1168.54,"more question"

EWIPLzuXlek,1196.59,"the past when I have not defended myself"
EWIPLzuXlek,1198.96,"and have allowed things to happen"
EWIPLzuXlek,1201.96,"many women happen anymore good for you"
EWIPLzuXlek,1204.9,"you know many women do allow it to"
EWIPLzuXlek,1207.48,"happen for what reason I really don't"

EWIPLzuXlek,1212.28,"to live on their own and they have to"
EWIPLzuXlek,1214.2,"you know have the male support or"
EWIPLzuXlek,1217.59,"they're just dependent dependent on lots"

EWIPLzuXlek,1225.51,"the man they can't leave them they can't"
EWIPLzuXlek,1228.27,"do anything to hurt them but all in fact"

f6KpCBYx58s,0.08,"all right complete chaos at the end of"
f6KpCBYx58s,2.48,"this game gotta break down what exactly"
f6KpCBYx58s,4.72,"happened here did the right the cowboys"
f6KpCBYx58s,6.64,"get screwed was it their own wrongdoing"
f6KpCBYx58s,9.44,"what happened so first let's set the"
f6KpCBYx58s,11.12,"stage uh cowboys have no timeouts left"
f6KpCBYx58s,13.28,"they're down six at their own 40 there's"
f6KpCBYx58s,15.44,"14 seconds left as you can clearly see"
f6KpCBYx58s,18.08,"from looking on the field what san"
f6KpCBYx58s,19.92,"francisco is doing is it's a sideline"
f6KpCBYx58s,21.68,"defense they're not going to let you get"
f6KpCBYx58s,22.88,"to the sidelines if you're going to"
f6KpCBYx58s,24.24,"throw the ball you have to throw the"
f6KpCBYx58s,25.359,"ball over the middle or just go for the"
f6KpCBYx58s,27.279,"end zone on this play me personally i go"
f6KpCBYx58s,30.08,"for the ends and on display you get an"
f6KpCBYx58s,31.599,"opportunity and even if you don't get it"
f6KpCBYx58s,33.28,"you still get another chance for hail"
f6KpCBYx58s,34.8,"mary i think that's the preferable"
f6KpCBYx58s,36.48,"strategy here uh dallas doing something"
f6KpCBYx58s,38.8,"you don't see too often when you have no"
f6KpCBYx58s,40.719,"timeouts left and there's only 14"
f6KpCBYx58s,42.079,"seconds which is a quarterback draw"
f6KpCBYx58s,44.079,"which i get the logic behind you gain a"
f6KpCBYx58s,45.92,"good amount of yards since no one's over"
f6KpCBYx58s,47.52,"the middle and then you get up spike the"
f6KpCBYx58s,50.079,"ball you get one more shot towards the"
f6KpCBYx58s,52.559,"end zone here uh and it's a lot easier"
f6KpCBYx58s,54.879,"just getting 20 yards than 40 yards so i"
f6KpCBYx58s,56.64,"get the logic behind it i'm just not a"
f6KpCBYx58s,58.399,"huge fan of it however uh this would not"
f6KpCBYx58s,60.719,"be the craziest thing that would happen"
f6KpCBYx58s,62.16,"so look prescott takes a snap he runs"
f6KpCBYx58s,64.239,"the play it's well executed by dallas"
f6KpCBYx58s,66.24,"people make their blocks prescott"
f6KpCBYx58s,68.0,"actually even slides which is not the"
f6KpCBYx58s,69.6,"worst strategy either because if he runs"
f6KpCBYx58s,72.24,"into a tackle then someone can kind of"
f6KpCBYx58s,74.08,"stay on top of him for a while maybe try"
f6KpCBYx58s,75.759,"to fight for the ball when you're on the"
f6KpCBYx58s,77.36,"ground which could result in more time"
f6KpCBYx58s,79.119,"and you don't have a chance to run one"
f6KpCBYx58s,80.72,"final play so smart stuff by prescott i"
f6KpCBYx58s,83.2,"wonder if that's how that was designed"
f6KpCBYx58s,84.96,"actually but you look at it nine seconds"
f6KpCBYx58s,86.96,"left you have time to spike it everyone"
f6KpCBYx58s,88.96,"knows you have to get up for a potential"
f6KpCBYx58s,90.799,"spike but the weird thing that's gonna"
f6KpCBYx58s,92.56,"happen here is i don't get why doc"
f6KpCBYx58s,93.92,"prescott doesn't hand this ball to the"
f6KpCBYx58s,95.84,"referee look prescott's instead gonna"
f6KpCBYx58s,97.84,"hand it to the center and you have to"
f6KpCBYx58s,99.6,"spot the ball you don't get to just put"
f6KpCBYx58s,100.96,"the ball down and then spike it right"
f6KpCBYx58s,102.24,"that's not how football works you don't"
f6KpCBYx58s,104.079,"get to decide where you had the ball the"
f6KpCBYx58s,106.079,"referee has to touch it which basically"
f6KpCBYx58s,108.32,"is the way that they say you know if you"
f6KpCBYx58s,109.759,"do hand it to your center the referee"
f6KpCBYx58s,111.2,"just has to touch it which then means"
f6KpCBYx58s,112.56,"that it's a legal plan you can go"
f6KpCBYx58s,114.399,"however dallas just doesn't seem to be"
f6KpCBYx58s,115.759,"ready for this i mean look they"
f6KpCBYx58s,116.799,"literally have a wall in front of the"
f6KpCBYx58s,118.56,"referee the referee's doing what he can"
f6KpCBYx58s,120.399,"to get over and touch the football i"
f6KpCBYx58s,121.759,"think he's doing the right thing here"
f6KpCBYx58s,123.04,"people are going to get mad at the refs"
f6KpCBYx58s,124.479,"here but like what are you supposed to"
f6KpCBYx58s,125.92,"do you have a wall of players trying to"
f6KpCBYx58s,128.0,"get through i mean he's trying to get"
f6KpCBYx58s,129.2,"there as much as he can watch how he's"
f6KpCBYx58s,130.8,"going to even literally shove prescott"
f6KpCBYx58s,132.319,"out of the way to spot the ball that's"
f6KpCBYx58s,134.16,"good refereeing in my opinion by him uh"
f6KpCBYx58s,137.2,"i don't think that's a bad play"
f6KpCBYx58s,138.319,"whatsoever but because of that little"
f6KpCBYx58s,140.08,"delay that took too much time in the"
f6KpCBYx58s,142.319,"dallas actually had the ball it looked"
f6KpCBYx58s,144.48,"like with one second left but then"
f6KpCBYx58s,145.92,"spiked it with zero seconds left to me"
f6KpCBYx58s,147.76,"that's not dallas you got to give the"
f6KpCBYx58s,149.36,"referee a lane to touch the football and"
f6KpCBYx58s,151.84,"spot it or really just give the referee"
f6KpCBYx58s,153.84,"the ball right away i would also say"
f6KpCBYx58s,155.519,"it's just a risky play call in general"
f6KpCBYx58s,157.2,"and i don't think it's really worth it"
f6KpCBYx58s,158.48,"so again people are going to blame the"
f6KpCBYx58s,160.239,"refs it's always very fun to blame the"
f6KpCBYx58s,162.4,"refs i don't get how you put that one on"
f6KpCBYx58s,164.08,"the refs that's just my understanding of"
f6KpCBYx58s,166.239,"you know how this stuff works i don't"
f6KpCBYx58s,168.0,"really think it's it's uh an issue i"
f6KpCBYx58s,170.16,"think that that's on dallas that's"
f6KpCBYx58s,172.16,"that's what i think but i'm sure you all"
f6KpCBYx58s,174.319,"will agree with me there will be no hot"
f6KpCBYx58s,176.239,"takes whatsoever no we're all gonna"
f6KpCBYx58s,177.599,"disagree in the comments but that's okay"
f6KpCBYx58s,179.12,"what do you guys think in the comments"
f6KpCBYx58s,180.48,"below i always love hearing from you and"
f6KpCBYx58s,182.4,"of course as always thanks for"
FA9jS8qN0JA,0.32,"so as women we realize that we are an"
FA9jS8qN0JA,2.0,"easier target for men to"
FA9jS8qN0JA,4.24,"attack us not all serial killers aren't"
FA9jS8qN0JA,7.6,"necessarily the ones that attack us it"
FA9jS8qN0JA,8.96,"can be a"
FA9jS8qN0JA,9.679,"family member boyfriend father or a"
FA9jS8qN0JA,12.08,"loved one"
FA9jS8qN0JA,13.12,"and so we made this video with a"
FA9jS8qN0JA,15.12,"different scenarios of each and how we"
FA9jS8qN0JA,16.96,"would get out of those"
FA9jS8qN0JA,18.32,"situations if we were to ever be"
FA9jS8qN0JA,19.84,"attacked and women should always be"
FA9jS8qN0JA,21.68,"aware of the surroundings and they can"
FA9jS8qN0JA,23.039,"use anything"
FA9jS8qN0JA,23.92,"as a weapon like the key for example or"
FA9jS8qN0JA,26.08,"your cell phone"
FA9jS8qN0JA,27.039,"or just anything you have on you or if"
FA9jS8qN0JA,29.599,"you don't have anything on you what"
FA9jS8qN0JA,31.599,"let's do okay so this would be a"
FA9jS8qN0JA,34.399,"scenario of a boyfriend and a girlfriend"
FA9jS8qN0JA,36.48,"fighting and the boyfriend attacking"
FA9jS8qN0JA,38.8,"the girlfriend by choking her"
FA9jS8qN0JA,47.44,"so when he chokes me i cut my hands and"
FA9jS8qN0JA,49.52,"hit his ears to throw him off"
FA9jS8qN0JA,51.36,"and then his group his grip loosens and"
FA9jS8qN0JA,54.48,"i"
FA9jS8qN0JA,54.879,"hit him down hit him in the neck so this"
FA9jS8qN0JA,58.32,"is a scenario of a drunken dad and a"
FA9jS8qN0JA,60.32,"daughter"
FA9jS8qN0JA,61.12,"and she has free of movement unlike the"
FA9jS8qN0JA,63.68,"previous one when she's pinned up the"
FA9jS8qN0JA,70.84,"wall"
FA9jS8qN0JA,76.0,"so when he starts choking me i grip him"
FA9jS8qN0JA,78.4,"like like this"
FA9jS8qN0JA,79.36,"i don't grip him like this because then"
FA9jS8qN0JA,80.96,"he can like"
FA9jS8qN0JA,82.56,"he has control over me so i grip him"
FA9jS8qN0JA,84.479,"like this"
FA9jS8qN0JA,85.759,"put my palm on his sternum"
FA9jS8qN0JA,88.799,"sternum and then i go with all my force"
FA9jS8qN0JA,93.28,"and then i stomp on his foot and then"
FA9jS8qN0JA,96.64,"he goes down so i put both hands"
FA9jS8qN0JA,99.68,"on his shoulder so i can elbow him"
FA9jS8qN0JA,102.72,"and elbow him knee him and then he falls"
FA9jS8qN0JA,105.759,"down"
FA9jS8qN0JA,108.799,"okay so basically i'm going to be on my"
FA9jS8qN0JA,111.36,"phone"
FA9jS8qN0JA,111.84,"distracted and he's gonna come and pull"
FA9jS8qN0JA,114.399,"me by my ponytail and i'm gonna use my"
FA9jS8qN0JA,116.479,"phone as a weapon"
FA9jS8qN0JA,124.399,"okay so when he told me i used my phone"
FA9jS8qN0JA,127.36,"and i hit him in the temple with"
FA9jS8qN0JA,129.119,"the support and then i kicked him"
FA9jS8qN0JA,132.48,"in the park yeah that"
FA9jS8qN0JA,135.52,"area and he fell and i ran"
FA9jS8qN0JA,139.04,"um so this is another scenario you can"
FA9jS8qN0JA,140.8,"do without having your phone to use"
FA9jS8qN0JA,142.8,"a hammer fist"
FA9jS8qN0JA,150.239,"so when i pull my ponytail i go around"
FA9jS8qN0JA,153.04,"my hammer fist"
FA9jS8qN0JA,154.72,"into his temple and if he doesn't let go"
FA9jS8qN0JA,157.28,"i go like this"
FA9jS8qN0JA,158.72,"and then i use my elbow to hit him in"
FA9jS8qN0JA,161.36,"the temple again so we can have a little"
FA9jS8qN0JA,162.959,"bit more"
FA9jS8qN0JA,164.4,"and then you rotten it okay so what i'm"
FA9jS8qN0JA,167.76,"going to be doing is running"
FA9jS8qN0JA,169.519,"and i'm gonna have an attacker pull my"
FA9jS8qN0JA,171.599,"arm"
FA9jS8qN0JA,172.72,"so i have to get out of that"
FA9jS8qN0JA,184.159,"okay so i'm running he grabs me and what"
FA9jS8qN0JA,186.56,"i do is i use my thumb"
FA9jS8qN0JA,189.04,"to just pull out of it go"
FA9jS8qN0JA,192.48,"and then i just go like that and i can"
FA9jS8qN0JA,194.959,"escape like that"
FA9jS8qN0JA,196.4,"and then you so anything can be used as"
FA9jS8qN0JA,198.48,"a weapon like as a keys i'm going to"
FA9jS8qN0JA,200.239,"walk to my car and he's going to try to"
FA9jS8qN0JA,203.12,"attack me"
FA9jS8qN0JA,203.84,"so i'm going to use my keys to defend"
FA9jS8qN0JA,206.0,"her bye be safe"
FA9jS8qN0JA,224.959,"give me a purse"
FA9jS8qN0JA,232.08,"okay so when i was walking to my car"
FA9jS8qN0JA,235.12,"he decided to attack me so then i"
FA9jS8qN0JA,251.04,"and then i drive away and call thank you"
FA9jS8qN0JA,254.08,"for watching our video"
FA9jS8qN0JA,255.439,"um i hope you learned something from"
FA9jS8qN0JA,256.959,"this everyone should always be aware of"
FA9jS8qN0JA,258.56,"their surroundings"
FA9jS8qN0JA,259.84,"and always walk in groups always um"
FA9jS8qN0JA,263.04,"you know don't be on your cell phone if"
FA9jS8qN0JA,264.24,"you're walking alone and you don't walk"
FA9jS8qN0JA,266.08,"alone in the dark"
FA9jS8qN0JA,267.68,"and you can use anything as your weapon"
FA9jS8qN0JA,269.36,"from your shoe"
FA9jS8qN0JA,270.8,"to a key to your cell phone to yourself"
FA9jS8qN0JA,273.6,"never underestimate"

gbKccBmvv28,240.64,"nobody gets through life unscathed we"
gbKccBmvv28,242.879,"all carry scars i have more scars on my"
gbKccBmvv28,245.76,"body than the average person but those"
gbKccBmvv28,248.0,"aren't important"
gbKccBmvv28,251.12,"the important ones are the scars we"
gbKccBmvv28,253.28,"carry"
gbKccBmvv28,254.72,"on the inside"
gbKccBmvv28,256.32,"that are harder to see"
gbKccBmvv28,258.72,"and sometimes we try and cover up these"
gbKccBmvv28,260.639,"scars sometimes we try to pretend these"
gbKccBmvv28,262.56,"scars aren't there but those are the"
gbKccBmvv28,264.639,"scars that we should be proud of those"
gbKccBmvv28,266.479,"are the scars that tell our story those"
gbKccBmvv28,269.199,"are the scars that give us strength"

gbKccBmvv28,273.84,"people we are"
gbKccBmvv28,278.88,"now nobody's perfect all right"
gbKccBmvv28,281.52,"if everybody was perfect the world will"
gbKccBmvv28,283.36,"be a very boring place so nobody"
gbKccBmvv28,285.919,"nobody no matter who you are should be"
gbKccBmvv28,287.68,"afraid to stand up in front of the whole"

gbKccBmvv28,292.24,"makes you the person that you are scares"
gbKccBmvv28,294.72,"it all and say hey this is me"

gbKccBmvv28,311.52,"who want to write me off"
gbKccBmvv28,313.68,"i'm sure there are plenty of people who"
gbKccBmvv28,315.68,"doubt me and you know what it won't be"
gbKccBmvv28,317.28,"the first time it won't be the last time"

gbKccBmvv28,322.96,"say whatever you want to say you go"
gbKccBmvv28,324.32,"ahead and think whatever you want to"
gbKccBmvv28,326.24,"think i'll tell you the same thing i"
gbKccBmvv28,328.16,"would have told that black demon that"
gbKccBmvv28,329.68,"cloud hanging over me in my dream you"
gbKccBmvv28,331.44,"can take all that and shove it"
gbKccBmvv28,333.12,"right up your ass"

gbKccBmvv28,397.759,"very very liberating there is no hell"
gbKccBmvv28,400.08,"that can be put upon me in this ring"
gbKccBmvv28,402.319,"that i haven't been through and worse so"

GPJ210kTrDw,0.08,"did you know that you can buy a power"
GPJ210kTrDw,1.52,"bank that charges itself a building"
GPJ210kTrDw,3.76,"that's actually alive or a worm that"
GPJ210kTrDw,5.92,"could save the planet welcome to 21"
GPJ210kTrDw,8.639,"heavenly inventions that will restore"
GPJ210kTrDw,10.24,"your faith in humanity from divine to"
GPJ210kTrDw,13.2,"glorious"
GPJ210kTrDw,14.639,"to godly now one of humanity's key"
GPJ210kTrDw,18.0,"crimes to this planet is how we've"
GPJ210kTrDw,19.76,"littered plastic everywhere"
GPJ210kTrDw,22.72,"this is a brand new cloud as well"
GPJ210kTrDw,24.8,"however there's a company called"
GPJ210kTrDw,26.32,"reprieve who is collecting that plastic"
GPJ210kTrDw,28.96,"and using it to make clothes"
GPJ210kTrDw,31.599,"like this this jacket right here is 30"
GPJ210kTrDw,34.079,"recycled plastic bottles and if you go"
GPJ210kTrDw,36.239,"to their website you can actually see"
GPJ210kTrDw,37.44,"the live counter of how many they've"
GPJ210kTrDw,39.12,"taken out of seas and landfill they've"
GPJ210kTrDw,41.52,"just passed 30 billion so i'm gonna give"
GPJ210kTrDw,44.399,"reprieve a"
GPJ210kTrDw,46.0,"two out of ten"
GPJ210kTrDw,47.36,"blissful invention don't get me wrong"
GPJ210kTrDw,49.12,"it's just things are about to get much"
GPJ210kTrDw,50.8,"cooler"
GPJ210kTrDw,52.96,"put this back in my cloud storage"
GPJ210kTrDw,55.28,"because it's not just water bottles one"
GPJ210kTrDw,56.879,"of our main contributors to plastic"
GPJ210kTrDw,58.32,"waste actually comes from toiletries"
GPJ210kTrDw,60.64,"every single bottle of shampoo or body"
GPJ210kTrDw,62.399,"wash that you buy has its own separate"
GPJ210kTrDw,64.479,"plastic packaging"
GPJ210kTrDw,66.72,"it's not mine i promise"
GPJ210kTrDw,68.32,"but thanks to a german product designer"
GPJ210kTrDw,70.72,"johnna breton hoover"
GPJ210kTrDw,72.4,"there is not a chance i pronounced that"
GPJ210kTrDw,74.4,"correctly we are getting the soap bottle"
GPJ210kTrDw,77.28,"packaging that can store liquid personal"
GPJ210kTrDw,79.119,"care products but the minute they're"
GPJ210kTrDw,80.88,"finished can be used"
GPJ210kTrDw,82.88,"for soap it's one of those ideas that"
GPJ210kTrDw,84.72,"would never randomly occur to you but as"
GPJ210kTrDw,87.119,"soon as you see it"
GPJ210kTrDw,88.56,"it just makes sense and not gonna lie i"
GPJ210kTrDw,91.04,"think they look gorgeous too three out"
GPJ210kTrDw,93.2,"of ten"
GPJ210kTrDw,94.159,"so i got a box from xiaomi the other day"
GPJ210kTrDw,96.32,"but what's really interesting about it"
GPJ210kTrDw,98.079,"is not actually what's inside more what"
GPJ210kTrDw,100.88,"it came in this packaging has a very"
GPJ210kTrDw,103.04,"unusual almost like spongy texture to it"
GPJ210kTrDw,106.079,"and after looking into it i realized"
GPJ210kTrDw,107.439,"that's because this box is made of"
GPJ210kTrDw,110.0,"mushrooms you can get literal factories"
GPJ210kTrDw,112.32,"now that stick fungus sprouts into a"
GPJ210kTrDw,114.0,"mold and then just leave them and allow"
GPJ210kTrDw,115.759,"them to grow into the shape of that mold"
GPJ210kTrDw,118.0,"it's so nature friendly that i can just"
GPJ210kTrDw,120.0,"leave the box into the ground and it"
GPJ210kTrDw,121.84,"will break down and feed everything"
GPJ210kTrDw,123.36,"around it 4 out of 10 joyously simple"
GPJ210kTrDw,127.439,"did you know that a french company"
GPJ210kTrDw,128.8,"called new wind has started building"
GPJ210kTrDw,130.399,"wind trees where each leaf is a blade"
GPJ210kTrDw,133.04,"that generates electricity using the air"
GPJ210kTrDw,135.28,"and while i would say that wind isn't"
GPJ210kTrDw,137.2,"the most reliable energy source i think"
GPJ210kTrDw,139.44,"structures like this are the way to go"
GPJ210kTrDw,141.44,"you just build them once and you have a"
GPJ210kTrDw,143.04,"permanent tourist attraction that can"
GPJ210kTrDw,145.04,"also generate electricity continuously"
GPJ210kTrDw,147.36,"and silently"
GPJ210kTrDw,149.2,"i tried to climb the tree i promise"
GPJ210kTrDw,151.76,"now number 17 is a piece that was"
GPJ210kTrDw,154.239,"recently on display at the london design"
GPJ210kTrDw,155.92,"festival and"
GPJ210kTrDw,157.599,"for good reason i'm talking about a"
GPJ210kTrDw,159.44,"living chandelier which instead of glass"
GPJ210kTrDw,162.4,"or crystal is primarily surrounded by"
GPJ210kTrDw,164.319,"lab-created leaves that contain actual"
GPJ210kTrDw,166.56,"living algae the benefit being that it"
GPJ210kTrDw,169.28,"still lights your room using a bulb on"
GPJ210kTrDw,170.959,"the inside like a normal chandelier but"
GPJ210kTrDw,173.28,"then that bulb also doubles as a source"
GPJ210kTrDw,175.12,"of light for the algae which can then"
GPJ210kTrDw,177.28,"photosynthesize take in carbon dioxide"
GPJ210kTrDw,179.519,"from the room"
GPJ210kTrDw,180.64,"and purify the air"
GPJ210kTrDw,182.64,"four out of ten but you can take this to"
GPJ210kTrDw,184.959,"the next level there is already a"
GPJ210kTrDw,186.48,"company called arep who's making"
GPJ210kTrDw,188.56,"algae-powered buildings i can't stress"
GPJ210kTrDw,192.08,"how cool this is these buildings are"
GPJ210kTrDw,193.92,"surrounded by large panels filled with"
GPJ210kTrDw,195.84,"algae that are not just purifying the"
GPJ210kTrDw,197.92,"air around them but are also using"
GPJ210kTrDw,200.159,"sunlight to generate the energy that's"
GPJ210kTrDw,202.239,"then harnessed to power the building and"
GPJ210kTrDw,205.44,"on top of that once the algae is fully"
GPJ210kTrDw,207.44,"grown it can then be taken out and used"
GPJ210kTrDw,209.84,"as fertilizer i gotta give this a 5 out"
GPJ210kTrDw,212.64,"of 10. these plants are literally god's"
GPJ210kTrDw,215.12,"gift to mankind"
GPJ210kTrDw,217.04,"right so here in the uk one of the ways"
GPJ210kTrDw,219.44,"that the government has tried to reduce"
GPJ210kTrDw,220.959,"our impact on the planet is by getting"
GPJ210kTrDw,222.879,"rid of single-use plastic straws and"
GPJ210kTrDw,225.44,"what i do think that the idea is right"
GPJ210kTrDw,227.44,"plastic straws regularly end up in"
GPJ210kTrDw,228.959,"beaches in seas and"
GPJ210kTrDw,230.799,"unfortunately in animals the alternative"
GPJ210kTrDw,233.599,"straw solutions"
GPJ210kTrDw,235.12,"kind of suck"
GPJ210kTrDw,236.4,"or should i say"
GPJ210kTrDw,238.159,"don't suck"
GPJ210kTrDw,239.36,"if you go anywhere now and order a soft"
GPJ210kTrDw,240.959,"drink you will get a paper straw and"
GPJ210kTrDw,243.36,"you'll basically have this continuous"
GPJ210kTrDw,244.959,"race to finish before it gets soaked and"
GPJ210kTrDw,247.439,"then starts to go floppy but this right"
GPJ210kTrDw,249.92,"here is a foldable reusable straw so you"
GPJ210kTrDw,253.68,"drink with it just like you would"
GPJ210kTrDw,254.959,"normally but then when you're done you"
GPJ210kTrDw,256.639,"can unfold it give it a wipe and then"
GPJ210kTrDw,258.799,"store it to be used again and again and"
GPJ210kTrDw,261.04,"again and the material is coated in such"
GPJ210kTrDw,262.88,"a way that it's naturally antibacterial"
GPJ210kTrDw,265.919,"now one of the biggest trends of the"
GPJ210kTrDw,267.919,"entire 21st century is the shift to"
GPJ210kTrDw,270.16,"vegan foods it can be better for the"
GPJ210kTrDw,272.16,"health whilst at the same time only"
GPJ210kTrDw,273.759,"causing about half the carbon emissions"
GPJ210kTrDw,276.16,"so for a lot of people it's just like"
GPJ210kTrDw,278.32,"well why wouldn't i"
GPJ210kTrDw,280.8,"bacon has been a pretty strong reason to"
GPJ210kTrDw,283.6,"not for many years"
GPJ210kTrDw,286.56,"until now where thanks to the whole load"
GPJ210kTrDw,288.88,"of proteins that we managed to extract"
GPJ210kTrDw,290.639,"from all sorts of vegetables and crops"
GPJ210kTrDw,293.12,"the production of facan has become"
GPJ210kTrDw,295.04,"possible apparently this is going to"
GPJ210kTrDw,296.96,"taste just like the real thing"
GPJ210kTrDw,299.199,"we'll do a taste test when it's fully"
GPJ210kTrDw,300.639,"cooked it smells amazing though"
GPJ210kTrDw,303.44,"and related to bacon"
GPJ210kTrDw,305.68,"you know what leather is right this"
GPJ210kTrDw,307.44,"premium material taken from a cow but"
GPJ210kTrDw,310.32,"have you ever wondered what on earth is"
GPJ210kTrDw,312.4,"this vegan leather that we keep hearing"
GPJ210kTrDw,313.84,"about"
GPJ210kTrDw,315.199,"it's actually kind of genius there's a"
GPJ210kTrDw,317.12,"company called pinatex who gather the"
GPJ210kTrDw,319.28,"leaves of pineapples which are usually"
GPJ210kTrDw,321.6,"just a waste product not needed by any"
GPJ210kTrDw,323.52,"other industry extract the fibers from"
GPJ210kTrDw,325.68,"them and then mix them with corn and"
GPJ210kTrDw,328.08,"they end up with a material that bears"
GPJ210kTrDw,329.6,"striking resemblance to the real thing"
GPJ210kTrDw,332.32,"and it's even better because it's not"
GPJ210kTrDw,334.08,"just that you're saving the animals but"
GPJ210kTrDw,335.84,"it's also that if those pineapple leaves"
GPJ210kTrDw,337.759,"weren't used then they would have"
GPJ210kTrDw,339.199,"instead been burned which is even more"
GPJ210kTrDw,341.52,"damage to the environment that we're now"
GPJ210kTrDw,343.12,"saving ourselves from"
GPJ210kTrDw,344.56,"six out of ten it really does give you"
GPJ210kTrDw,346.72,"hope"
GPJ210kTrDw,347.919,"most people don't realize this but every"
GPJ210kTrDw,349.6,"single time we take a shower we're using"
GPJ210kTrDw,351.52,"on average 2.5 gallons of water"
GPJ210kTrDw,355.68,"per minute for some perspective that"
GPJ210kTrDw,357.84,"means that if you treated yourself to a"
GPJ210kTrDw,359.68,"nice relaxing 25-minute shower that's"
GPJ210kTrDw,362.16,"the equivalent of 1 000 glasses of hot"
GPJ210kTrDw,364.84,"water literally down the drain"
GPJ210kTrDw,367.199,"just try to imagine a thousand glasses"
GPJ210kTrDw,369.919,"in the room you're in right now more"
GPJ210kTrDw,371.52,"than likely it would fill up every inch"
GPJ210kTrDw,373.52,"of space you have"
GPJ210kTrDw,374.96,"the general advice from governments is"
GPJ210kTrDw,376.56,"to well just cut your shower time by"
GPJ210kTrDw,378.72,"three minutes versus your normal"
GPJ210kTrDw,380.639,"but there might be a better way"
GPJ210kTrDw,382.24,"thanks to a company called nebia you can"
GPJ210kTrDw,384.08,"buy a shower head that atomizes water"
GPJ210kTrDw,386.56,"into millions of micro droplets that"
GPJ210kTrDw,389.12,"might sound like it would be really"
GPJ210kTrDw,390.639,"unsatisfying but the shower head has an"
GPJ210kTrDw,392.56,"extremely high internal pressure which"
GPJ210kTrDw,395.36,"means that these micro droplets are"
GPJ210kTrDw,396.8,"actually being pushed out three times"
GPJ210kTrDw,398.4,"faster than a normal shower pushes out"
GPJ210kTrDw,400.319,"water thus making less water actually"

GPJ210kTrDw,598.959,"special plate this is made by a company"

GPJ210kTrDw,618.24,"foods on them you can even put them in"
GPJ210kTrDw,619.92,"the oven but what moves this from good"

GPJ210kTrDw,629.519,"when done"
GPJ210kTrDw,633.12,"you can eat them"
GPJ210kTrDw,634.72,"all right so let's get the bacon on"
GPJ210kTrDw,636.24,"there"
GPJ210kTrDw,637.6,"three two"
GPJ210kTrDw,639.279,"one"
GPJ210kTrDw,646.8,"that bacon is amazing it's really smoky"
GPJ210kTrDw,649.68,"and greasy and meaty"
GPJ210kTrDw,652.0,"just like bacon"
GPJ210kTrDw,654.0,"the plate less so still the tastiest"
GPJ210kTrDw,656.32,"plate i've ever had"
GPJ210kTrDw,658.32,"but i think number six is even greater"
GPJ210kTrDw,661.04,"air"
GPJ210kTrDw,662.399,"inc which is such a gloriously simple"
GPJ210kTrDw,665.2,"concept that i could explain the whole"

GPJ210kTrDw,669.12,"pollution is a big problem in a lot of"
GPJ210kTrDw,671.04,"cities this company invented a device to"
GPJ210kTrDw,673.519,"capture their air pollution they've then"
GPJ210kTrDw,675.36,"turned that pollution into ink which"
GPJ210kTrDw,677.279,"sits inside actual pens that you can buy"
GPJ210kTrDw,681.04,"eight out of ten"
GPJ210kTrDw,683.6,"pretty incredible"
GPJ210kTrDw,686.72,"now"
GPJ210kTrDw,687.44,"we've seen lots of green initiatives"
GPJ210kTrDw,689.36,"over the last few decades people saying"
GPJ210kTrDw,691.36,"we should stop flying in planes people"
GPJ210kTrDw,693.04,"saying we should completely abandon meat"
GPJ210kTrDw,695.36,"and while these messages might come from"
GPJ210kTrDw,697.36,"a good place i think the main reason"
GPJ210kTrDw,699.279,"that they haven't stuck is that they"
GPJ210kTrDw,700.72,"require people to drastically change"
GPJ210kTrDw,702.399,"their behavior which"
GPJ210kTrDw,704.64,"most aren't going to do"
GPJ210kTrDw,706.48,"i think that the most viable"
GPJ210kTrDw,707.76,"technologies are the ones that can make"
GPJ210kTrDw,709.36,"the best out of our existing behaviors"
GPJ210kTrDw,712.24,"like pavegen pavegen have designed"
GPJ210kTrDw,714.639,"basically high-tech tiles that you can"
GPJ210kTrDw,716.399,"line your floors with and then when"
GPJ210kTrDw,718.079,"people step on those tiles it converts"
GPJ210kTrDw,720.079,"the kinetic energy from the pressure"
GPJ210kTrDw,721.68,"they've applied"
GPJ210kTrDw,722.88,"into electricity this tech has already"
GPJ210kTrDw,725.519,"been used many times for example there"
GPJ210kTrDw,727.2,"was a nightclub in london where people's"
GPJ210kTrDw,729.04,"dance moves alone were powering sixty"
GPJ210kTrDw,731.12,"percent of the venue"
GPJ210kTrDw,733.04,"eight out of ten"
GPJ210kTrDw,734.639,"we all love a two in one one solution"
GPJ210kTrDw,736.8,"that fixes two problems and plastic road"
GPJ210kTrDw,740.079,"is maybe my favorite example of it see"
GPJ210kTrDw,743.12,"when it comes to protecting our planet"
GPJ210kTrDw,745.04,"plastic is annoyingly durable it can"
GPJ210kTrDw,747.6,"take 500 years for this stuff to break"
GPJ210kTrDw,749.519,"down naturally but"
GPJ210kTrDw,751.44,"if you think about it there are times"
GPJ210kTrDw,752.959,"when that kind of durability is actually"
GPJ210kTrDw,755.2,"pretty great"
GPJ210kTrDw,756.639,"like roads so"
GPJ210kTrDw,758.399,"plastic road is using recycled plastic"
GPJ210kTrDw,760.639,"as a key material to make roads they're"
GPJ210kTrDw,763.279,"more durable they need less maintenance"
GPJ210kTrDw,765.279,"they don't get flooded thanks to the"
GPJ210kTrDw,766.8,"ability to store water inside of them"
GPJ210kTrDw,768.959,"and they save up to 72 percent of"
GPJ210kTrDw,771.2,"emissions from the simple fact that"
GPJ210kTrDw,772.959,"they're built using materials that have"
GPJ210kTrDw,775.2,"already been made"
GPJ210kTrDw,776.959,"okay these top three though i think have"
GPJ210kTrDw,779.279,"a good chance of completely changing our"
GPJ210kTrDw,781.12,"world for starters"
GPJ210kTrDw,783.279,"mealworms"
GPJ210kTrDw,784.56,"see the reason that there are so many"
GPJ210kTrDw,786.24,"initiatives created to tackle the"
GPJ210kTrDw,787.92,"plastic problem is because plastic is"
GPJ210kTrDw,790.32,"non-biodegradable or in other words"
GPJ210kTrDw,792.0,"every single piece of plastic that's"
GPJ210kTrDw,793.279,"produced is another piece of plastic"
GPJ210kTrDw,794.8,"that's going to sit somewhere and take"
GPJ210kTrDw,796.8,"up our already limited space or get"
GPJ210kTrDw,799.2,"burned but that's probably even worse"
GPJ210kTrDw,801.36,"for the environment however these little"
GPJ210kTrDw,803.519,"troopers might be turning that entire"
GPJ210kTrDw,805.44,"notion on its head because"
GPJ210kTrDw,808.16,"they can digest it it's looking like one"
GPJ210kTrDw,810.56,"of the natural enzymes produced by these"
GPJ210kTrDw,812.48,"mealworms has the ability to break"
GPJ210kTrDw,814.32,"plastic down in the same way that you"
GPJ210kTrDw,816.32,"probably have lactase enzymes which help"
GPJ210kTrDw,818.16,"you to break down and digest milk so if"
GPJ210kTrDw,820.88,"we can find a way to extract that enzyme"
GPJ210kTrDw,822.639,"and mass produce it we could potentially"
GPJ210kTrDw,824.639,"solve the entire world's plastic problem"
GPJ210kTrDw,827.12,"in a few months"
GPJ210kTrDw,828.8,"nine out of ten now what's the one"
GPJ210kTrDw,831.36,"trusty classic planet-saving technique"
GPJ210kTrDw,833.519,"that we all know about"
GPJ210kTrDw,836.079,"planting trees trees take in carbon"
GPJ210kTrDw,838.24,"dioxide trees release oxygen trees"
GPJ210kTrDw,840.32,"stabilize soil trees are a habitat for"
GPJ210kTrDw,842.56,"hundreds of thousands of animal species"
GPJ210kTrDw,844.48,"you get the idea but if you wanted to"
GPJ210kTrDw,846.959,"plant trees to match the pace of how"
GPJ210kTrDw,848.56,"quickly humanity is taking them down"
GPJ210kTrDw,850.72,"you need to hire an entire army full"
GPJ210kTrDw,852.8,"time to do so"

GPJ210kTrDw,894.24,"i will leave them linked after this one"

GPJ210kTrDw,924.079,"theoretical concept for a long time now"

GPJ210kTrDw,937.04,"stage in society"
GPJ210kTrDw,938.639,"but the challenge has always been if"

GPJ210kTrDw,948.72,"this is where things get clever remember"

GPJ210kTrDw,954.24,"that we can actually see"

h3MUY6CQqRA,1.52,"another planet the smallest planet pluto"
h3MUY6CQqRA,3.52,"which actually isn't a planet anymore"
h3MUY6CQqRA,4.96,"has an extremely low gravitational pull"
h3MUY6CQqRA,6.799,"compared to earth so you can jump 25"
h3MUY6CQqRA,9.04,"feet high on its surface jupiter however"
h3MUY6CQqRA,11.36,"has the strongest so you can only jump"
h3MUY6CQqRA,13.44,"six inches high so we thought how hard"
h3MUY6CQqRA,15.2,"would it be to live on earth with"
h3MUY6CQqRA,16.48,"jupiter's gravity today we're gonna find"
h3MUY6CQqRA,18.64,"out so the first thing we have to do is"
h3MUY6CQqRA,20.16,"we have to figure out how much we weigh"
h3MUY6CQqRA,21.68,"on jupiter so we found this cool website"
h3MUY6CQqRA,24.0,"that tells you what you weigh on the"
h3MUY6CQqRA,25.76,"different planets i'm gonna go first i'm"
h3MUY6CQqRA,27.76,"165 pounds let's see how much i weigh on"
h3MUY6CQqRA,30.0,"jupiter"
h3MUY6CQqRA,31.32,"417 pounds"
h3MUY6CQqRA,34.239,"that is heavy dude all right how much do"
h3MUY6CQqRA,35.84,"you weigh you're probably not done i"
h3MUY6CQqRA,37.04,"weigh 180 dude you're getting chong"
h3MUY6CQqRA,39.92,"is that dad dad all right 180 pounds"
h3MUY6CQqRA,42.559,"calculate chris you're going to weigh"
h3MUY6CQqRA,44.2,"455 pounds"
h3MUY6CQqRA,46.16,"thank you that's heavy so we wanted to"
h3MUY6CQqRA,48.0,"wear the weight the entire day but"
h3MUY6CQqRA,49.44,"jupiter's gravity is so crushing our"
h3MUY6CQqRA,51.36,"team cannot withstand the full gravity"
h3MUY6CQqRA,52.96,"for more than three minutes while"
h3MUY6CQqRA,54.239,"they're testing it out so we will work"
h3MUY6CQqRA,55.84,"up incrementally until we experience"
h3MUY6CQqRA,57.6,"jupiter's full gravity at the end of the"
h3MUY6CQqRA,59.199,"day i'm josh so i'm gonna do a little"
h3MUY6CQqRA,60.879,"medical check here because uh"
h3MUY6CQqRA,63.92,"because the gravity on jupiter is so"
h3MUY6CQqRA,65.76,"heavy you can put a lot of strain on"
h3MUY6CQqRA,67.04,"their bodies we could literally die"
h3MUY6CQqRA,68.56,"normal blush pressure am i gonna live"
h3MUY6CQqRA,70.08,"doc am i gonna lift 141 over 82. it's"
h3MUY6CQqRA,72.799,"actually a little bit high probably"
h3MUY6CQqRA,74.4,"because he's anxious all right"
h3MUY6CQqRA,75.52,"temperature's good oxygen is showing 94"
h3MUY6CQqRA,77.759,"which is a little bit low but it's okay"
h3MUY6CQqRA,79.68,"three just three three guys you're 131"
h3MUY6CQqRA,83.04,"over 79. so that's pretty good and your"
h3MUY6CQqRA,85.04,"oxygen level is okay so that's good"
h3MUY6CQqRA,86.72,"since you can only jump six inches on"
h3MUY6CQqRA,88.24,"jupiter's gravity we're gonna test how"
h3MUY6CQqRA,89.759,"high we can jump on earth's gravity so"
h3MUY6CQqRA,92.31,"[Music]"
h3MUY6CQqRA,96.24,"so we can jump about three and a half"
h3MUY6CQqRA,97.52,"feet on earth's gravity when we have all"
h3MUY6CQqRA,98.96,"the weight on we're going to test that"
h3MUY6CQqRA,100.0,"again see how high we can jump so we're"
h3MUY6CQqRA,101.36,"going to be putting some braces on"
h3MUY6CQqRA,102.56,"because obviously it's going to be a ton"
h3MUY6CQqRA,104.159,"of weight so we're starting at 20 we're"
h3MUY6CQqRA,105.92,"going to bump it up 20 every challenge"
h3MUY6CQqRA,108.0,"until we're at 100 of jupiter's gravity"
h3MUY6CQqRA,110.399,"okay this already feels really weird"
h3MUY6CQqRA,112.0,"that feels so much heavier"
h3MUY6CQqRA,114.88,"bro that was weak socks"
h3MUY6CQqRA,117.68,"there's now time to test out physically"
h3MUY6CQqRA,120.0,"what this gravity is like so we're going"
h3MUY6CQqRA,121.52,"to race around the baseball diamond"
h3MUY6CQqRA,122.96,"whoever makes it to the end first win"
h3MUY6CQqRA,125.2,"let's have a clean race all right ready"
h3MUY6CQqRA,127.6,"three"
h3MUY6CQqRA,129.119,"two"
h3MUY6CQqRA,130.239,"one"
h3MUY6CQqRA,131.28,"go"
h3MUY6CQqRA,132.16,"whoa"
h3MUY6CQqRA,133.36,"this is way harder than i thought it was"
h3MUY6CQqRA,134.959,"weird"
h3MUY6CQqRA,136.16,"this is weird"
h3MUY6CQqRA,137.36,"hey don't don't poison me"
h3MUY6CQqRA,140.0,"this is my argument i thought i'd be"
h3MUY6CQqRA,141.28,"able to go back dude"
h3MUY6CQqRA,145.12,"this is so weird"
h3MUY6CQqRA,147.68,"let me exhausted already oh yes he's"
h3MUY6CQqRA,150.16,"moving"
h3MUY6CQqRA,151.04,"run it home"
h3MUY6CQqRA,152.239,"no"
h3MUY6CQqRA,153.12,"no"
h3MUY6CQqRA,156.319,"you guys that was so hard dude that was"
h3MUY6CQqRA,158.319,"so weird you won started off running i"
h3MUY6CQqRA,160.48,"thought it was gonna be like normal"
h3MUY6CQqRA,162.56,"no my legs were just like nope"
h3MUY6CQqRA,164.56,"dude we're not even that full jupiter"
h3MUY6CQqRA,166.56,"gravity yet we're literally at 20"
h3MUY6CQqRA,169.12,"with the nearing lunch time we headed"
h3MUY6CQqRA,170.48,"over to chick-fil-a to get suited up"
h3MUY6CQqRA,171.92,"with another 20 gravity so we can"
h3MUY6CQqRA,173.92,"embarrass ourselves while we order some"
h3MUY6CQqRA,175.36,"food i weighed 280 pounds right now i"
h3MUY6CQqRA,177.76,"went 265 pounds this is like extremely"
h3MUY6CQqRA,180.48,"heavy trying to lift your leg up really"
h3MUY6CQqRA,182.84,"high i can't do it so we're pretty"
h3MUY6CQqRA,184.72,"hungry we're at chick-fil-a right now"
h3MUY6CQqRA,186.4,"we're gonna go order some space burgers"
h3MUY6CQqRA,189.84,"i'm getting winded already i can't wait"
h3MUY6CQqRA,191.76,"until we take the weights off and then"
h3MUY6CQqRA,193.12,"we see what it feels like to be light"
h3MUY6CQqRA,194.72,"again i've never been more humiliated in"
h3MUY6CQqRA,196.72,"my life because we got to get up the"
h3MUY6CQqRA,197.92,"curve no wait how are we going to do"
h3MUY6CQqRA,199.68,"this"
h3MUY6CQqRA,202.72,"look at that he wasn't too bad any"
h3MUY6CQqRA,204.4,"higher i wouldn't have made it hi can i"
h3MUY6CQqRA,206.319,"have a space"
h3MUY6CQqRA,211.519,"we burger the whole seat kristen there's"
h3MUY6CQqRA,213.28,"also no oxygen on jupiter how are we"
h3MUY6CQqRA,215.12,"breathing i feel like a moment"
h3MUY6CQqRA,217.44,"well eating is not very hard when they"
h3MUY6CQqRA,219.44,"were actually able to land on jupiter if"
h3MUY6CQqRA,221.12,"it even has a core i really hope it has"
h3MUY6CQqRA,223.28,"chick-fil-a"
h3MUY6CQqRA,224.56,"this came out chick-fil-a about three"
h3MUY6CQqRA,226.239,"pounds heavier feeling good"
h3MUY6CQqRA,229.519,"on to the next challenge every time we"
h3MUY6CQqRA,231.44,"increase gravity it became more"
h3MUY6CQqRA,232.799,"difficult just getting into the truck to"
h3MUY6CQqRA,234.239,"move to the next location"
h3MUY6CQqRA,237.519,"that leg's so heavy now for like two"
h3MUY6CQqRA,242.0,"yeah"
h3MUY6CQqRA,242.879,"time to weight up another twenty percent"
h3MUY6CQqRA,244.799,"he's about 50 pounds 50 pound weight oh"
h3MUY6CQqRA,248.08,"shoot that's heavy bro this is no joke"
h3MUY6CQqRA,250.72,"so this is really bad our next challenge"
h3MUY6CQqRA,252.56,"we have to make it all the way up to"
h3MUY6CQqRA,254.48,"daisy mountain"
h3MUY6CQqRA,255.76,"please you know what someone's got to"
h3MUY6CQqRA,256.959,"make a steak and make a claim over the"
h3MUY6CQqRA,258.639,"mountain so person up there"
h3MUY6CQqRA,262.0,"put their flag that means that person"
h3MUY6CQqRA,263.759,"owns all of daingy bros land"
h3MUY6CQqRA,266.32,"three two one"
h3MUY6CQqRA,268.479,"go"
h3MUY6CQqRA,269.36,"someone said he wins the race"
h3MUY6CQqRA,272.639,"i gotta take this nice and easy because"
h3MUY6CQqRA,274.32,"if i get really tired shoot i've already"
h3MUY6CQqRA,276.0,"tried i'm definitely not going straight"
h3MUY6CQqRA,278.0,"up the steepest part"
h3MUY6CQqRA,280.0,"i think chris had the same idea to walk"
h3MUY6CQqRA,282.0,"to the this"
h3MUY6CQqRA,283.52,"most slanted"
h3MUY6CQqRA,285.12,"part but this is already very"
h3MUY6CQqRA,286.56,"challenging and so it begins the world's"
h3MUY6CQqRA,288.88,"slowest foot race weighing over 300"
h3MUY6CQqRA,291.68,"pounds was no joke falling with this"
h3MUY6CQqRA,293.919,"weight on could end badly so we had our"
h3MUY6CQqRA,295.44,"team nearby just in case regulating our"
h3MUY6CQqRA,297.52,"heart rate was also extremely important"
h3MUY6CQqRA,299.759,"this is so hard and it's not even like"
h3MUY6CQqRA,302.4,"you're not even going up the mountain"
h3MUY6CQqRA,303.68,"we're barely even going up a slant i"
h3MUY6CQqRA,306.0,"don't know if we're making it to the top"
h3MUY6CQqRA,307.52,"dude 60 percent of jupiter's gravity i"
h3MUY6CQqRA,310.56,"really feel the weight on me guys i'm"
h3MUY6CQqRA,312.479,"not gonna let myself get to the point of"
h3MUY6CQqRA,314.0,"hyperventilation"
h3MUY6CQqRA,317.74,"[Music]"
h3MUY6CQqRA,318.96,"if either one of us falls down there may"
h3MUY6CQqRA,321.36,"be no getting up literally a turtle"
h3MUY6CQqRA,323.6,"could beat us up this mountain"
h3MUY6CQqRA,325.28,"oh this burns the legs boys"
h3MUY6CQqRA,327.36,"you gotta put the leaves here jeff fizz"
h3MUY6CQqRA,329.44,"burns your legs a lot chris has got a"

h3MUY6CQqRA,378.4,"it's another 50 pound dude so the next"
h3MUY6CQqRA,380.96,"challenge i'm going to attempt to jump"
h3MUY6CQqRA,382.479,"on this trip"
h3MUY6CQqRA,385.84,"sitting in the waiting limit right here"
h3MUY6CQqRA,388.88,"what"

h3MUY6CQqRA,402.72,"are they get off the ground no so i"
h3MUY6CQqRA,404.88,"think we just disproved that you can"
h3MUY6CQqRA,406.24,"jump six inches on jupiter with that"
h3MUY6CQqRA,408.08,"myth busted we headed over to the final"
h3MUY6CQqRA,409.759,"challenge before we weighed it up to the"
h3MUY6CQqRA,411.28,"full weight of jupiter's gravity and we"
h3MUY6CQqRA,412.88,"had to try sports with extra gravity"
h3MUY6CQqRA,414.4,"because we all have probably wondered"
h3MUY6CQqRA,415.759,"what it would be like playing sports on"
h3MUY6CQqRA,417.28,"different planets all right first of"
h3MUY6CQqRA,418.96,"three wins let's start at half court"
h3MUY6CQqRA,428.479,"how are you doing that bro"
h3MUY6CQqRA,434.08,"i almost fell in"
h3MUY6CQqRA,437.759,"did i move my pants no"

h3MUY6CQqRA,442.4,"cousin all right shoot it crazy"
h3MUY6CQqRA,461.12,"no"
h3MUY6CQqRA,472.8,"how bad are my pants they're pretty bad"
h3MUY6CQqRA,474.879,"but we only have one more challenge at"
h3MUY6CQqRA,476.639,"this point we were exhausted the sun was"
h3MUY6CQqRA,478.4,"setting and jupiter's gravity was taking"
h3MUY6CQqRA,480.16,"its toll we had to rest up to be ready"
h3MUY6CQqRA,482.24,"to take on the final challenge where one"
h3MUY6CQqRA,484.4,"of us would be eliminated guys we've"
h3MUY6CQqRA,486.479,"been having all of this with us for"
h3MUY6CQqRA,488.24,"hours it's about to get worse dude it's"
h3MUY6CQqRA,490.4,"been five hours you guys don't even"

h3MUY6CQqRA,546.32,"force of a jupiter storm"
h3MUY6CQqRA,549.519,"so we have a cloudy like clock right"
h3MUY6CQqRA,551.68,"there liver can last the longest with"
h3MUY6CQqRA,553.36,"jupiter's gravity winds so fun fact"
h3MUY6CQqRA,555.44,"about jupiter's storms this is the great"
h3MUY6CQqRA,557.2,"red spot it is 3 000 miles longer than"
h3MUY6CQqRA,559.6,"earth so earth itself could fit inside"
h3MUY6CQqRA,561.6,"of it this storm has been going on for"
h3MUY6CQqRA,563.36,"over 500 years so we tried recreating"
h3MUY6CQqRA,565.68,"jupiter's storm but this was all we got"

H3NqUB-lMeU,48.0,"car and if you can buy the car right and"
H3NqUB-lMeU,50.16,"then you can make its history better"
H3NqUB-lMeU,52.16,"either by documenting it on facebook or"
H3NqUB-lMeU,54.64,"a forum or the vinwicki app or using it"
H3NqUB-lMeU,56.719,"and proving that it's still a great car"
H3NqUB-lMeU,58.559,"or fixing it up and making it nicer you"

H3NqUB-lMeU,90.88,"like you and when he said that i knew"
H3NqUB-lMeU,92.799,"that lamborghini had only produced 10"
H3NqUB-lMeU,94.799,"manual lp 640 roadsters for the us 22"
H3NqUB-lMeU,98.0,"coupes and i also knew that until they"

H3NqUB-lMeU,102.96,"manual cars it was the rarest car that"
H3NqUB-lMeU,105.2,"lamborghini had ever produced in the"
H3NqUB-lMeU,107.04,"whole lifespan of the company so they're"
H3NqUB-lMeU,108.479,"very very rare very very special and of"
H3NqUB-lMeU,110.88,"those 10 cars only two have a bad"
H3NqUB-lMeU,113.36,"history one of them is a car that was in"
H3NqUB-lMeU,115.2,"a flood shortly after i sold it at"
H3NqUB-lMeU,116.799,"lamborghini atlanta i know that the"
H3NqUB-lMeU,118.32,"owner has no interest in selling it"
H3NqUB-lMeU,119.759,"because i've asked him that several"
H3NqUB-lMeU,121.28,"times and so i knew which car it had to"
H3NqUB-lMeU,123.36,"be it's a 2009 manual lp 640 roadster in"
H3NqUB-lMeU,126.88,"nero nemesis matt black and the car was"
H3NqUB-lMeU,129.28,"originally ordered by ralph lauren in"
H3NqUB-lMeU,131.36,"fact he ordered two of them identically"
H3NqUB-lMeU,133.68,"and he didn't take delivery of either"
H3NqUB-lMeU,135.44,"back in 2009 you couldn't sell any"
H3NqUB-lMeU,136.959,"exotic cars and he just backed out of"
H3NqUB-lMeU,138.319,"the orders he did take delivery of a"
H3NqUB-lMeU,139.76,"matte black lp 670 and sv but these cars"
H3NqUB-lMeU,142.959,"were sold through two different dealers"
H3NqUB-lMeU,144.48,"this one in particular was sold through"
H3NqUB-lMeU,145.76,"manhattan motor cars the other one had"
H3NqUB-lMeU,147.36,"been sold through lamborghini st louis"
H3NqUB-lMeU,149.04,"and i'd actually brokered deals to sell"
H3NqUB-lMeU,150.8,"that car twice most recently to a"
H3NqUB-lMeU,152.64,"billionaire with a huge collection of"
H3NqUB-lMeU,154.0,"cars in seattle and i knew that he"
H3NqUB-lMeU,155.76,"wasn't going to be selling that car ever"
H3NqUB-lMeU,157.12,"if he ever does it'll be a seven figure"
H3NqUB-lMeU,158.64,"number and so it's a very nice car but"
H3NqUB-lMeU,160.56,"this car i knew had been in two minor"
H3NqUB-lMeU,162.72,"accidents each documented on carfax"
H3NqUB-lMeU,164.56,"about a year apart in 2016 and 2017. and"
H3NqUB-lMeU,166.959,"so i always followed the car in the"
H3NqUB-lMeU,168.48,"vinwicki app and i'd heard different"
H3NqUB-lMeU,170.239,"rumors about the car i heard that it"
H3NqUB-lMeU,171.519,"hadn't been repaired all that well and"
H3NqUB-lMeU,173.12,"that it was really just sort of driven"
H3NqUB-lMeU,174.56,"like a car and until somebody went and"
H3NqUB-lMeU,176.56,"told the world how rare manual lp 640s"
H3NqUB-lMeU,178.64,"were that's how a lot of them were"
H3NqUB-lMeU,179.92,"driven they were just cars the people"
H3NqUB-lMeU,181.28,"just enjoyed them drove them they liked"
H3NqUB-lMeU,182.959,"that they were manual cars maybe or some"
H3NqUB-lMeU,184.959,"of them didn't even care but eger was"
H3NqUB-lMeU,186.959,"such a popular option that most of them"
H3NqUB-lMeU,189.68,"obviously were ordered in that way now"
H3NqUB-lMeU,191.599,"this car as it turns out was driven by"
H3NqUB-lMeU,193.92,"the original owner who bought it after"
H3NqUB-lMeU,195.44,"ralph lauren had backed out and he just"
H3NqUB-lMeU,197.2,"drove it around new york and new jersey"
H3NqUB-lMeU,198.72,"with a can of matte black spray paint"
H3NqUB-lMeU,200.56,"and when he bumped into something he"
H3NqUB-lMeU,201.92,"would just spray paint over it so all"
H3NqUB-lMeU,204.159,"the wheels were curved and and the"
H3NqUB-lMeU,206.0,"accidents they hadn't been repaired all"
H3NqUB-lMeU,207.519,"that well the paintwork that was done"
H3NqUB-lMeU,208.879,"wasn't very good and at one point the"
H3NqUB-lMeU,210.799,"rear bumper had not been replaced with"
H3NqUB-lMeU,212.319,"an oem part it had been replaced with an"
H3NqUB-lMeU,214.56,"aftermarket really bad sv bumper that"
H3NqUB-lMeU,216.72,"was warping and stuff like that it had"
H3NqUB-lMeU,218.08,"this sv style duct tail wing all the"
H3NqUB-lMeU,221.04,"parts that were supposed to be gloss"
H3NqUB-lMeU,222.64,"black were in fact painted now matte"
H3NqUB-lMeU,224.319,"black so that was the wheels that was"
H3NqUB-lMeU,226.48,"the areas behind the glass that was a"
H3NqUB-lMeU,228.0,"windscreen frame the mirrors and for"
H3NqUB-lMeU,229.76,"somebody like me who really appreciates"
H3NqUB-lMeU,231.44,"the car in the stock form it's hard to"
H3NqUB-lMeU,233.92,"look at and it was going to be quite the"
H3NqUB-lMeU,235.599,"stigma the car was stale on service the"
H3NqUB-lMeU,237.519,"tires were 10 years old parts of the top"
H3NqUB-lMeU,239.519,"were missing it just wasn't anywhere"
H3NqUB-lMeU,242.319,"near showroom ready so when a guy like"
H3NqUB-lMeU,244.159,"john tamarin curated even though he buys"
H3NqUB-lMeU,246.4,"amazing super cars every day including"
H3NqUB-lMeU,249.04,"manual mercy's gets offered a car like"
H3NqUB-lMeU,251.2,"that it doesn't really fit the business"
H3NqUB-lMeU,252.799,"model because he has access to millions"
H3NqUB-lMeU,254.159,"and millions of dollars if he needs to"
H3NqUB-lMeU,255.2,"buy a miura sv or a bugatti eb110 but"
H3NqUB-lMeU,259.12,"for something like this you're talking"
H3NqUB-lMeU,260.479,"about a 12 to 18 month reconditioning"
H3NqUB-lMeU,262.479,"process and i'd already done that twice"
H3NqUB-lMeU,264.08,"with the iranian terrorist drug dealer"
H3NqUB-lMeU,266.32,"grigio telesto canadian manual lp 640"
H3NqUB-lMeU,269.12,"and the black car that became the verde"
H3NqUB-lMeU,271.199,"draco car and so i was no stranger to"
H3NqUB-lMeU,272.96,"what this would take but i mean it's 50"
H3NqUB-lMeU,274.639,"70 80 000"
H3NqUB-lMeU,276.32,"worth of stuff that you're gonna do to"
H3NqUB-lMeU,277.68,"this car between now and when it would"
H3NqUB-lMeU,279.44,"ever be ready for a normal retail sale"
H3NqUB-lMeU,282.0,"and so he calls and he's like ed do you"
H3NqUB-lMeU,283.36,"want this car and"
H3NqUB-lMeU,284.639,"of course i do you know like i say that"
H3NqUB-lMeU,286.479,"yes to a lot of cars most of them end up"
H3NqUB-lMeU,288.16,"not coming to fruition i knew in this"
H3NqUB-lMeU,289.759,"case that it probably would but i also"
H3NqUB-lMeU,291.52,"knew that this was a real wholesale"
H3NqUB-lMeU,293.199,"style transaction so the moment i say"
H3NqUB-lMeU,295.44,"yes i'm on the hook for it it doesn't"
H3NqUB-lMeU,297.68,"matter if it shows up and it's a little"
H3NqUB-lMeU,298.96,"bit worse or anything like that like"
H3NqUB-lMeU,300.639,"it's my car a couple of days later it"
H3NqUB-lMeU,302.96,"does show up at curated and he calls me"
H3NqUB-lMeU,304.639,"and he says ed this is your kind of"
H3NqUB-lMeU,306.96,"mercy and that was not exactly the"
H3NqUB-lMeU,308.8,"intonation that i love to hear when it's"
H3NqUB-lMeU,310.72,"attached to that idea and so"
H3NqUB-lMeU,313.44,"around that same time we had just"
H3NqUB-lMeU,314.88,"finished filming cartridge six and so"
H3NqUB-lMeU,316.56,"that meant that i had the cayenne the"
H3NqUB-lMeU,317.84,"996 the s55 that i needed to start to"
H3NqUB-lMeU,320.4,"get rid of i had the 5.99 still i've"
H3NqUB-lMeU,323.28,"barely driven the gallardo spider from"
H3NqUB-lMeU,324.8,"car trek one in a long time i kind of"
H3NqUB-lMeU,326.8,"finished all the fun adventures to go on"
H3NqUB-lMeU,328.4,"in the slr and i couldn't think of a"
H3NqUB-lMeU,329.84,"whole lot more reasons to drive it i'd"
H3NqUB-lMeU,331.6,"barely been able to drive my mercy i"
H3NqUB-lMeU,333.28,"knew it was going to need a few things"
H3NqUB-lMeU,334.479,"service-wise coming up i've driven the"
H3NqUB-lMeU,336.24,"skutt a lot because it was always the"
H3NqUB-lMeU,337.36,"most functional car and i'd done some"
H3NqUB-lMeU,338.639,"rallies in it but regardless it was kind"
H3NqUB-lMeU,340.72,"of the weight of having so many cars was"
H3NqUB-lMeU,343.6,"on me"
H3NqUB-lMeU,344.56,"and the idea of spending the next year"
H3NqUB-lMeU,346.32,"reconditioning this car to either flip"
H3NqUB-lMeU,348.24,"or decide if it was going to be more of"
H3NqUB-lMeU,349.759,"a permanent fixture in the collection"
H3NqUB-lMeU,352.0,"was a little bit more daunting at the"
H3NqUB-lMeU,354.0,"same time the el alpha l hefe shiron was"
H3NqUB-lMeU,356.88,"coming up for sale at the copart auction"
H3NqUB-lMeU,359.12,"and i'd talked to bugatti north america"
H3NqUB-lMeU,360.88,"about my interest in that car like most"
H3NqUB-lMeU,362.8,"people you hear about a cheap recently"
H3NqUB-lMeU,364.72,"on fire shiron i'm gonna want to have"
H3NqUB-lMeU,366.8,"that car but the fact that it had a"
H3NqUB-lMeU,368.08,"certificate of destruction had sort of"
H3NqUB-lMeU,369.36,"turned them off of it in fact the"
H3NqUB-lMeU,370.56,"bugatti factory was thinking about"

H3NqUB-lMeU,543.519,"thought a lot about having two mercies"

H3NqUB-lMeU,546.56,"furious car that freddie ended up buying"
H3NqUB-lMeU,548.24,"and i ended up deciding that wasn't"

hQd_pgIRpVU,241.92,"i made a video called"

hQd_pgIRpVU,244.959,"dot dot dot"
hQd_pgIRpVU,246.4,"i bought an abandoned mansion so"

hQd_pgIRpVU,256.959,"yay"
hQd_pgIRpVU,258.32,"that was two and a half years ago"
hQd_pgIRpVU,260.56,"we bought this house i had"
hQd_pgIRpVU,262.88,"zero idea it would take that long now"
hQd_pgIRpVU,264.96,"granted we went a little more overkill"
hQd_pgIRpVU,267.28,"than is what we had planned i had bought"
hQd_pgIRpVU,269.199,"this house thinking we were going to"
hQd_pgIRpVU,270.479,"just"
hQd_pgIRpVU,271.199,"flip it that was the plan"
hQd_pgIRpVU,273.52,"and"
hQd_pgIRpVU,274.32,"we wouldn't have done as much to it"
hQd_pgIRpVU,276.639,"for instance an underground you know"
hQd_pgIRpVU,278.88,"vault probably not needed for a flip"
hQd_pgIRpVU,282.639,"but since we decided we want to do this"
hQd_pgIRpVU,284.479,"house for us"
hQd_pgIRpVU,286.08,"we were like well let's make it exactly"
hQd_pgIRpVU,287.919,"how we would want it we've never built a"
hQd_pgIRpVU,290.0,"house before we probably will never"
hQd_pgIRpVU,291.44,"build a house again it's a big headache"
hQd_pgIRpVU,293.199,"i don't know if you'll know"
hQd_pgIRpVU,295.04,"but we thought man this is the one time"
hQd_pgIRpVU,296.8,"let's let's do it and let's do it right"
hQd_pgIRpVU,299.68,"and"
hQd_pgIRpVU,301.28,"it took two and a half years you know"
hQd_pgIRpVU,302.56,"all the uh supply chain issues didn't"
hQd_pgIRpVU,304.88,"help much"
hQd_pgIRpVU,306.16,"um that definitely gave us a lot of"
hQd_pgIRpVU,308.4,"delays but"
hQd_pgIRpVU,309.759,"we're in"
hQd_pgIRpVU,311.36,"and it's kind of surreal like we"
hQd_pgIRpVU,313.039,"freaking did it"
hQd_pgIRpVU,314.72,"and a lot of people"
hQd_pgIRpVU,316.24,"you know who you are from the very"
hQd_pgIRpVU,317.759,"beginning we're like whoa guys"
hQd_pgIRpVU,320.88,"matt you need to chill you bit off more"
hQd_pgIRpVU,322.8,"than you can chew here buddy like you"
hQd_pgIRpVU,324.4,"don't know"
hQd_pgIRpVU,325.52,"how big our project that is"
hQd_pgIRpVU,327.84,"and you're right i didn't know how big"
hQd_pgIRpVU,329.84,"of a project it was and it was huge but"
hQd_pgIRpVU,332.32,"i didn't know how huge but a lot of you"
hQd_pgIRpVU,333.919,"guys doubted just saying here we are"
hQd_pgIRpVU,336.72,"with a"
hQd_pgIRpVU,337.68,"mostly done house it's livable so the"
hQd_pgIRpVU,340.639,"drive you may be like man why did your"
hQd_pgIRpVU,342.32,"drive not go further it's just because"
hQd_pgIRpVU,344.4,"we still have big trucks coming in and"
hQd_pgIRpVU,346.32,"so we are going to only do the drive out"
hQd_pgIRpVU,349.28,"to there right now we just got the"
hQd_pgIRpVU,350.56,"circle done and in front of the"
hQd_pgIRpVU,354.56,"garage here so the circle is done going"
hQd_pgIRpVU,356.88,"up to the house a little parking over"
hQd_pgIRpVU,358.24,"there"
hQd_pgIRpVU,359.039,"parking here in front of the garage and"
hQd_pgIRpVU,360.319,"then a little parking spot over there so"
hQd_pgIRpVU,361.68,"we have a little extra room if we have"
hQd_pgIRpVU,363.44,"some more cars come and then later we"
hQd_pgIRpVU,365.759,"will finish out the"
hQd_pgIRpVU,367.919,"road so it's not going to be dirt road"
hQd_pgIRpVU,369.84,"to get to a concrete parking lot that's"
hQd_pgIRpVU,372.479,"coming at a different date after we get"
hQd_pgIRpVU,374.56,"some other work done where big trucks"
hQd_pgIRpVU,376.08,"are going to come in we don't want them"
hQd_pgIRpVU,377.039,"to mess up this road"
hQd_pgIRpVU,379.12,"but now that we have"
hQd_pgIRpVU,381.28,"all of this driveway done we can start"
hQd_pgIRpVU,382.88,"with the landscaping out here so initial"
hQd_pgIRpVU,385.919,"plan we need some trees some bushes some"
hQd_pgIRpVU,388.319,"grass"
hQd_pgIRpVU,389.28,"pretty much all this brown stuff will be"
hQd_pgIRpVU,391.44,"green stuff eventually we need some"
hQd_pgIRpVU,393.36,"color some life in front of this house"
hQd_pgIRpVU,395.84,"because it's been"
hQd_pgIRpVU,397.28,"basically just rock and dead for a while"
hQd_pgIRpVU,399.919,"not for long"
hQd_pgIRpVU,401.28,"do you guys want to go in the house"
hQd_pgIRpVU,403.44,"we're freaking moving in there's stuff"
hQd_pgIRpVU,405.919,"in our fridge"
hQd_pgIRpVU,407.36,"there are sheets on our beds mayor and"
hQd_pgIRpVU,410.08,"i've been working"

I4qPeV2AZvU,145.86,"that"

I4qPeV2AZvU,156.09,"right it's kind of hard to defend"
I4qPeV2AZvU,157.86,"something that you don't know is coming"
I4qPeV2AZvU,159.75,"so first she wants to take away my"
I4qPeV2AZvU,163.05,"balance slightly so one more team onto"
I4qPeV2AZvU,165.81,"her wrists she drives her elbows to my"
I4qPeV2AZvU,168.209,"knees she just brought my hands from a"
I4qPeV2AZvU,172.11,"very balanced position to a less"
I4qPeV2AZvU,173.7,"balanced position now that my hands are"
I4qPeV2AZvU,175.95,"right by my knees she's gonna lift her"
I4qPeV2AZvU,178.92,"hips as high as she can because now in"
I4qPeV2AZvU,181.11,"order for me not to fall on my face"
I4qPeV2AZvU,183.209,"which nobody's gonna do I have to put my"
I4qPeV2AZvU,185.67,"hands on the floor which means I have to"
I4qPeV2AZvU,187.59,"let go of her wrist so one more time"
I4qPeV2AZvU,189.68,"we're here to bring your elbows into"
I4qPeV2AZvU,192.03,"this race as soon as my hands hit the"
I4qPeV2AZvU,196.47,"floor that's her opportunity to move"
I4qPeV2AZvU,198.42,"she's gonna trap one of my arms and this"
I4qPeV2AZvU,202.65,"is gonna lift her hips again make me"
I4qPeV2AZvU,204.93,"fall forward and then make me fall over"
I4qPeV2AZvU,207.239,"so once she brings my hands in she lifts"
I4qPeV2AZvU,212.459,"her hips up my hands go forward she"
I4qPeV2AZvU,215.13,"traps"
I4qPeV2AZvU,215.81,"you would think at this point all she"
I4qPeV2AZvU,218.07,"has to do is rotate what she's gonna do"
I4qPeV2AZvU,221.04,"if she rotates at this point is rotate"
I4qPeV2AZvU,223.23,"into this knee which means I'm gonna be"
I4qPeV2AZvU,226.079,"able to resist her so instead of"
I4qPeV2AZvU,228.57,"rotating into this nice she's gonna make"
I4qPeV2AZvU,230.31,"me do a forward first and then I will"
I4qPeV2AZvU,232.14,"collapse into the trapped side makes"
I4qPeV2AZvU,234.299,"sense if you cut the leg off over the"
I4qPeV2AZvU,237.359,"table and push it forward it will"
I4qPeV2AZvU,239.7,"collapse onto the trapped side so here"
I4qPeV2AZvU,241.98,"we go"
I4qPeV2AZvU,243.799,"she's got a wrist trap elbows come in"
I4qPeV2AZvU,246.63,"just go up trash my one and then Oh"
I4qPeV2AZvU,254.06,"looks pretty easy I weigh 185 pounds"
I4qPeV2AZvU,258.63,"she's not lifting 185 pounds she's"
I4qPeV2AZvU,261.45,"changing the weight distribution of 185"
I4qPeV2AZvU,264.21,"pounds my knees are on the floor the"
I4qPeV2AZvU,266.52,"floor is supporting my weight she's just"
I4qPeV2AZvU,268.77,"making me fall forward and off to the"
I4qPeV2AZvU,270.539,"side one more time"
I4qPeV2AZvU,275.21,"elbows in"
I4qPeV2AZvU,276.72,"hips up trap as opposed to wiggle wiggle"
I4qPeV2AZvU,285.09,"wiggle"
I4qPeV2AZvU,285.75,"so let's talk about that Gabrielle Rula"
I4qPeV2AZvU,288.57,"and Ruben says wiggle your hips that's"
I4qPeV2AZvU,293.52,"all you have to do because the bones in"
I4qPeV2AZvU,295.05,"your hips are gonna attack my groin we"
I4qPeV2AZvU,299.43,"put your hips no really trying to hurt"
I4qPeV2AZvU,301.86,"me do I look like this matters it's"
I4qPeV2AZvU,307.14,"ridiculous"
I4qPeV2AZvU,307.95,"this woman has never ever been in a"
I4qPeV2AZvU,309.78,"fight in her life I can guarantee it"
I4qPeV2AZvU,312.39,"so this myths the myth if you want to"
I4qPeV2AZvU,319.11,"get somebody off of you when you're"
I4qPeV2AZvU,320.28,"holding onto your wrist you have to"
I4qPeV2AZvU,321.48,"disrupt their balance trap an arm and"

IaMu949MBgQ,231.1,"grader and I remember he kind of rushed"
IaMu949MBgQ,233.08,"me into the wall I was trying to assault"
IaMu949MBgQ,235.93,"me the good thing about it is that"
IaMu949MBgQ,237.75,"number one out unable to go back to that"
IaMu949MBgQ,241.12,"experience I had and see how I couldn't"
IaMu949MBgQ,244.0,"have done a different movie so some of"
IaMu949MBgQ,245.2,"the techniques that I had learned here"
IaMu949MBgQ,247.29,"of course as a martial arts and"
IaMu949MBgQ,249.46,"self-defense instructor my final"
IaMu949MBgQ,250.9,"objective is that they learn these"
IaMu949MBgQ,252.19,"life-saving skills to protect themselves"
IaMu949MBgQ,254.08,"in a real you know altercation or sexual"
IaMu949MBgQ,256.42,"assault situation well I know the basics"
IaMu949MBgQ,259.989,"so this is the first step the second"
IaMu949MBgQ,261.58,"step is perfecting reflex development"
IaMu949MBgQ,264.49,"going over these moves over and over so"
IaMu949MBgQ,266.56,"that I can build that confidence and"
IaMu949MBgQ,267.94,"instill that confidence in myself more"
IaMu949MBgQ,270.04,"importantly to also teach others I was"
IaMu949MBgQ,273.4,"shocked to see the level of enthusiasm"
IaMu949MBgQ,275.77,"and I guess dedication that the selected"
IaMu949MBgQ,281.32,"individuals put forward to to learn"
IaMu949MBgQ,284.05,"these techniques and to I guess acquire"
IaMu949MBgQ,286.42,"this knowledge I had high hopes but they"
IaMu949MBgQ,289.06,"were exceeded and of course pleasantly"
IaMu949MBgQ,291.55,"surprised to see that I just can't wait"
IaMu949MBgQ,293.86,"to see you know what they do with this"
IaMu949MBgQ,295.48,"information how many people they're able"
IaMu949MBgQ,297.7,"to share it with so I am extremely"
IaMu949MBgQ,299.35,"excited to kind of to see what happens"
IaMu949MBgQ,301.57,"next"
IaMu949MBgQ,301.93,"and I can't wait to come back next year"
IaMu949MBgQ,303.55,"and to see how many thousands of you"
IaMu949MBgQ,305.62,"know men and/or women are are have been"
IaMu949MBgQ,307.54,"empowered with these techniques I just"
IaMu949MBgQ,309.61,"hope that you know they remember who"
IaMu949MBgQ,310.72,"taught it to them so they don't abuse"
IaMu949MBgQ,312.31,"you know the origin of the techniques"
IaMu949MBgQ,314.08,"and they're they're nice to me when I"
IaMu949MBgQ,315.13,"get back here"
ic-b0JFJzlE,0.96,"hi it's nick from learn karate i'm going"
ic-b0JFJzlE,2.8,"to show you some self-defense techniques"
ic-b0JFJzlE,4.799,"here's gemma we're going to show you a"
ic-b0JFJzlE,6.399,"little routine of seven things"
ic-b0JFJzlE,8.0,"we're going to show you how to get out"
ic-b0JFJzlE,9.12,"of a knife attack and then we've got a"
ic-b0JFJzlE,11.36,"few things just to finish up there's a"
ic-b0JFJzlE,12.639,"little bonus"
ic-b0JFJzlE,13.679,"so the first thing if someone's coming"
ic-b0JFJzlE,15.28,"in to attack you it's very important"
ic-b0JFJzlE,17.199,"that you"
ic-b0JFJzlE,17.68,"create your boundary so what we're going"
ic-b0JFJzlE,19.84,"to do first is we're going to go like"
ic-b0JFJzlE,21.119,"that"
ic-b0JFJzlE,21.68,"so gemma okay and as you do it the"
ic-b0JFJzlE,24.88,"second thing is"
ic-b0JFJzlE,26.08,"actually shout stop because you want to"
ic-b0JFJzlE,28.24,"alert people around you that there's"
ic-b0JFJzlE,29.519,"something going on"
ic-b0JFJzlE,30.72,"so now with with shouting stop okay"
ic-b0JFJzlE,34.079,"and what's happening here is if you look"
ic-b0JFJzlE,35.68,"at gemma's fingers they're pointing"
ic-b0JFJzlE,37.2,"right for my eyes"
ic-b0JFJzlE,38.239,"we're going to demonstrate this"
ic-b0JFJzlE,42.8,"so let's do it the whole thing okay"
ic-b0JFJzlE,45.92,"so i'm coming in all right stop okay and"
ic-b0JFJzlE,49.12,"here i am"
ic-b0JFJzlE,50.239,"whoa okay that's how you get out of that"
ic-b0JFJzlE,53.36,"sort of situation"
ic-b0JFJzlE,54.8,"so there's three parts to that"
ic-b0JFJzlE,56.079,"techniques the first one is there"
ic-b0JFJzlE,58.0,"and stop numbers one and two stop and"
ic-b0JFJzlE,60.96,"then it's just straight in with that"
ic-b0JFJzlE,62.64,"well done excellent so now a little"
ic-b0JFJzlE,64.879,"routine that you can do"
ic-b0JFJzlE,66.159,"so the first thing is i've been watching"
ic-b0JFJzlE,68.4,"a few self-defense videos and"
ic-b0JFJzlE,70.799,"actually the key thing i think that's"
ic-b0JFJzlE,72.08,"missing is about distancing because"
ic-b0JFJzlE,73.92,"someone here"
ic-b0JFJzlE,74.88,"is a different type of threat to someone"
ic-b0JFJzlE,76.56,"here is a different type of threat to"
ic-b0JFJzlE,78.64,"someone here"
ic-b0JFJzlE,79.6,"so we've got a little routine for you so"
ic-b0JFJzlE,81.68,"first of all off the back foot"
ic-b0JFJzlE,83.439,"we're going to be kicking and we're"
ic-b0JFJzlE,85.119,"coming up straight where it hurts"
ic-b0JFJzlE,87.84,"so you can keep the back leg um straight"
ic-b0JFJzlE,90.159,"and it's just in"
ic-b0JFJzlE,91.04,"off you go have a go back leg"
ic-b0JFJzlE,94.64,"so if i'm coming into gemma if i'm this"
ic-b0JFJzlE,96.96,"distance apart"
ic-b0JFJzlE,98.0,"oh yes that works okay if i get a little"
ic-b0JFJzlE,100.96,"bit nearer"
ic-b0JFJzlE,102.159,"she can then do the same thing but off"
ic-b0JFJzlE,103.52,"the front foot oh"
ic-b0JFJzlE,105.2,"yes and then by getting a little bit"
ic-b0JFJzlE,108.72,"nearer because they haven't worked or"
ic-b0JFJzlE,110.159,"she hasn't seen me in time"
ic-b0JFJzlE,111.759,"she's actually going to use the hardest"
ic-b0JFJzlE,113.119,"part of the human body which is the"
ic-b0JFJzlE,114.56,"elbow"
ic-b0JFJzlE,115.36,"all the bone in here oh so i've come in"
ic-b0JFJzlE,118.88,"i've got in here"
ic-b0JFJzlE,119.84,"so the first thing is she's going to go"
ic-b0JFJzlE,122.0,"with the left"
ic-b0JFJzlE,123.439,"straightening yeah okay and then"
ic-b0JFJzlE,126.479,"i'm in really close you've got to go in"
ic-b0JFJzlE,128.479,"with the right"
ic-b0JFJzlE,129.52,"so we've got this little routine so from"
ic-b0JFJzlE,132.239,"here with me"
ic-b0JFJzlE,133.12,"so it's back foot front foot"
ic-b0JFJzlE,136.72,"front elbow back elbow okay"
ic-b0JFJzlE,140.56,"so let's put it all together so we've"
ic-b0JFJzlE,142.8,"got one two three four five six seven so"
ic-b0JFJzlE,144.879,"with me"
ic-b0JFJzlE,145.599,"and stop um stop eyes"
ic-b0JFJzlE,148.64,"back foot front foot left elbow"
ic-b0JFJzlE,152.319,"right elbow bang and in excellent what'd"
ic-b0JFJzlE,155.92,"you do someone's coming"
ic-b0JFJzlE,156.72,"with a knife so the key thing is to get"
ic-b0JFJzlE,160.64,"out of the way"
ic-b0JFJzlE,161.92,"and to answer and to take this hand out"
ic-b0JFJzlE,164.64,"so from here i'm going to just come in"
ic-b0JFJzlE,166.239,"i'm just going to attack"
ic-b0JFJzlE,167.519,"okay so gemma's going gonna step off so"
ic-b0JFJzlE,169.76,"i'm coming in"
ic-b0JFJzlE,170.72,"go she comes in she steps over"
ic-b0JFJzlE,174.08,"and she there keeps my arm straight and"
ic-b0JFJzlE,176.319,"she breaks my arm"
ic-b0JFJzlE,177.68,"her out her shoulder is right where my"
ic-b0JFJzlE,179.76,"elbow is"
ic-b0JFJzlE,180.72,"i've got nowhere to go so as long as she"
ic-b0JFJzlE,183.12,"keeps upright"
ic-b0JFJzlE,184.48,"that was going to hurt me so"
ic-b0JFJzlE,188.239,"just a few things to finish off this"
ic-b0JFJzlE,189.68,"very quick demo there's loads more in"
ic-b0JFJzlE,191.2,"the program"
ic-b0JFJzlE,192.239,"so the first thing is the most important"
ic-b0JFJzlE,194.239,"thing in self-defense"
ic-b0JFJzlE,195.519,"is what's called zanshin it's called"
ic-b0JFJzlE,197.2,"awareness it's trying to not get into"
ic-b0JFJzlE,198.959,"the situation where you have to do"
ic-b0JFJzlE,200.239,"anything physical"
ic-b0JFJzlE,201.599,"most black belts i know and i've been a"
ic-b0JFJzlE,203.12,"black belt for nearly 25 years they"
ic-b0JFJzlE,205.599,"don't use their"
ic-b0JFJzlE,206.64,"techniques because they don't need to"
ic-b0JFJzlE,208.48,"they can just send things going"
ic-b0JFJzlE,210.159,"and they go the other way one final"
ic-b0JFJzlE,212.799,"technique for you very quickly"
ic-b0JFJzlE,214.56,"so this is how to get out of a bear hug"
ic-b0JFJzlE,216.799,"from behind"
ic-b0JFJzlE,218.0,"so what we want to do here is if i've"
ic-b0JFJzlE,219.76,"come in and i've got gemma"
ic-b0JFJzlE,221.28,"she wants to create some distance"
ic-b0JFJzlE,223.36,"between us because what she's going to"
ic-b0JFJzlE,224.879,"do"
ic-b0JFJzlE,225.44,"with this hand she's going to keep it"
ic-b0JFJzlE,227.2,"straight and she's coming straight into"
ic-b0JFJzlE,229.12,"my groin"
ic-b0JFJzlE,230.159,"but she can't do that from here so she's"
ic-b0JFJzlE,232.56,"going to create some distance"
ic-b0JFJzlE,234.0,"yes and whoa oh yes and that works"
ic-b0JFJzlE,238.0,"okay well done so final thing"
ic-b0JFJzlE,241.36,"if anyone ever gets you in a fight or"
ic-b0JFJzlE,242.879,"anything like that for me"
ic-b0JFJzlE,244.56,"there's no rules if i haven't started"
ic-b0JFJzlE,246.48,"the fight"
ic-b0JFJzlE,247.76,"there's no rules i'm gonna bite i'm just"
ic-b0JFJzlE,250.48,"gonna go for everything"

IO6y4TxZZ7Q,191.76,"all right well let's go ahead and hit"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,193.12,"sizzle's back you want to mess with me"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,194.64,"boy do you know who i'm is"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,196.8,"you know who i miss i'm your daddy i"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,199.12,"don't know what that means all right so"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,200.64,"uh hold on after this yeah i got four"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,203.2,"nukes this will be fun grab my flint and"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,205.44,"steal there we go now after i hit sigils"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,207.92,"back i will start the process of"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,210.319,"becoming the richest person on this"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,212.319,"server i'll show you guys guys how it's"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,214.959,"pretty op okay let's do this here we go"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,216.879,"okay"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,217.519,"so"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,218.72,"is central's on the server he is okay"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,220.48,"search is on the server so if i use this"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,222.319,"bound dislocator on him it'll teleport"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,224.799,"me to him he's always in his base i"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,227.2,"don't even care about being invisible i"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,229.36,"am striking back he will know"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,234.27,"[Music]"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,238.84,"hello schedules"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,243.12,"you want to mess with me"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,246.56,"this is what happens sigils when you"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,249.12,"mess with me one nuke activate it"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,253.68,"another nuke"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,255.519,"activate it"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,257.359,"another nuke activate it"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,260.56,"and then a nuke up here"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,269.6,"this is what you get"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,272.24,"no no no no no this is what you get"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,277.77,"[Laughter]"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,282.16,"you want oh um what did you do"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,284.72,"[Music]"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,286.8,"i have negative three frames"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,289.759,"oh i'm good"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,291.28,"i just threw an ender pearl on accident"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,292.8,"um"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,293.84,"oh"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,296.56,"and my face"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,299.52,"this is what you get sigils don't ever"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,303.44,"attack me again that is my gauntlet i"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,306.56,"was the richest person now you um die"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,312.72,"this means war stundy"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,316.16,"bring it you peasant bring it it means"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,319.68,"war all right now let's work on the"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,321.84,"process of becoming the richest person"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,323.68,"on the server okay so as you guys know"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,326.08,"before henry gave me a philosopher's"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,328.56,"stone"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,329.68,"for some emc dumbest trade he's ever"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,333.039,"done because the philosopher's stone"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,334.8,"check this out look at what all it takes"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,338.16,"all of this stuff like all of these"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,340.32,"things are crazy expensive like you guys"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,343.039,"have no like look at this look at this"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,344.24,"look at this it takes a reality stone to"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,346.88,"make the philosopher's stone to get a"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,348.56,"reality stone you need all of the five"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,351.28,"infinity stones and he gave it to me for"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,353.44,"free"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,354.34,"[Applause]"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,357.44,"what an idiot thank you all right now"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,359.68,"that we have this what i need to do i"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,362.16,"need to make something called a"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,363.68,"transmutation"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,365.6,"table right so if i make this there goes"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,368.319,"i got the flash stone i need uh what is"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,370.08,"this stone and obsidian there we go"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,373.12,"the transmutation table boys new"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,376.479,"chapters unlocked this brings us down a"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,379.84,"path where we will become so rich that"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,382.96,"we can buy"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,384.8,"die"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,385.68,"chicken nuggets whatever we want"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,387.919,"even at 3 a.m"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,390.8,"and eat them"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,392.72,"all right well let's go ahead and put"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,393.759,"this down so transmutation table how"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,395.68,"this works i open this for you guys look"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,397.84,"at this you got all these thingies right"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,399.12,"so bottom left i have emc of zero but"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,402.16,"check this out let's say i go in here"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,404.56,"and let me grab some"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,406.72,"iron there we go i got some iron you see"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,408.639,"how iron has an emc of 256. so i take a"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,413.12,"piece of iron put this in the fire"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,415.599,"now i have 256 uh iron"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,418.639,"and i have iron learned now check this"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,421.039,"out if i go in here let me type in a"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,422.639,"cobblestone you're gonna type in some"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,423.759,"cobblestones guys grab some cobblestone"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,425.36,"put some cobblestone in here now i have"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,427.199,"310 emc and i can turn all of this iron"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,430.96,"into cobblestone because cobblestone"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,432.56,"equals one emc so i just turned all this"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,434.639,"iron into uh five stacks of cobblestone"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,438.16,"so that's how that works now i have 8"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,440.319,"000 emc"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,443.039,"so i can essentially"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,445.12,"turn items into currency and then"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,448.08,"currency into more items and as you guys"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,450.72,"remember at octuple"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,453.44,"i had an entire base full of octuple"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,456.56,"compressed cobblestone which if you look"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,458.08,"at that 43 million emc per block"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,462.88,"yeah that's what happens when you"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,465.199,"get sad now what i could do to get a"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,467.759,"bunch of emc right but this isn't as"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,470.0,"efficient right i could put down a"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,471.52,"cobblestone generator endless"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,473.199,"cobblestone i put an item extraction"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,476.319,"cable and then put one of these energy"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,478.16,"condensers under this"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,479.919,"it starts filling with cobblestone right"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,481.919,"and then let's say a i put a let's say"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,484.72,"iron put a piece of iron"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,487.28,"in"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,488.0,"here right up here there we go it starts"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,490.84,"converting all of the the cobblestone"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,493.68,"into iron and it's just like a slow"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,495.919,"process like look how slow i'm getting"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,497.84,"emc it's kind of slow right you know"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,500.479,"it's kind of slow it's not not real"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,502.16,"worth it that's the slow path"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,504.879,"but if i can get this to work correctly"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,507.84,"we are gonna make so much emc"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,511.12,"we will become billionaires okay uh"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,514.159,"project e yeah so this is the mod this"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,516.24,"is called project e so yeah these things"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,518.56,"here these are called basic power flower"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,521.76,"bonsai pot this is a level one and it"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,524.64,"goes all the way up to level 15."
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,529.6,"all right well uh let's go ahead and"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,531.04,"start with level one shall we all right"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,532.72,"so this costs basic uh relay mark one"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,536.72,"emc of seventy four thousand to make"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,539.04,"this oh gosh what is this obsidian got a"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,541.279,"bunch of that glass got a bunch of that"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,542.88,"what is this uh outer renalius fuel"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,545.279,"block what is that"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,546.959,"of an alias fuel emc sixteen thousand"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,549.519,"per"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,550.399,"what is this oh i gotta use the"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,551.839,"philosopher's stone on mobius fuel four"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,554.399,"thousand emc what is that uh i gotta do"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,556.959,"alchemical coal what is that what is"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,558.959,"this red coal resonator i gotta put coal"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,561.76,"in a resonator and get red coal oh"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,563.279,"that's easy i got a resonator right yeah"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,565.12,"i got a resonator oh it's easy so i just"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,567.12,"put coal in there yeah there we go now"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,568.8,"we're getting red coal all right now can"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,570.72,"i put can i put this in here oh i can't"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,573.12,"learn that though that's fine that's"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,574.24,"fine that's fine once i get enough of"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,575.76,"this i can learn the next stage"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,577.76,"philosopher's stone with that there we"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,579.44,"go now we have this and now i can learn"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,581.36,"this"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,582.32,"right throw this in here boom now i can"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,584.24,"pull out a bunch of that yeah we're"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,586.08,"cheating and then i use this"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,588.32,"i put that in there and then do that"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,590.56,"there we go now we have mobius fuel"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,593.2,"throw this in here and learn it now i"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,595.04,"can pull this out"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,596.72,"oh this is broken i love this game all"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,599.12,"right so now i need a bunch of this at"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,600.32,"wait do i have other fuel types you know"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,601.76,"what i'm just going to grab let's grab a"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,603.279,"bunch of emeralds there we go all right"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,605.04,"let's load this up okay i already got"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,606.8,"six million emc thank you"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,610.32,"oh i cheat this is cheating if i do that"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,613.12,"there we go now i have alterious"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,615.44,"whatever that's called learn that there"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,617.12,"we go now i pull that out"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,619.04,"and i should have enough"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,621.04,"right project e if i want to make this"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,622.959,"basic flower project e there we go there"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,626.24,"we go now i can make this block perfect"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,628.48,"now i can learn this in here no i just"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,631.44,"pull out the blocks"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,633.68,"this mod is so sick right like you just"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,636.959,"duplicate blocks like crazy now i should"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,639.6,"be able to make these basic relays right"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,642.0,"there we go so i take that i put this in"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,645.36,"here learn that and then spam this i"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,648.48,"have 14."
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,651.36,"oh this is good all right so we have all"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,653.839,"of that now the next thing i need this"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,656.16,"is called a basic energy emc link one"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,659.36,"eternity"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,660.399,"later all right i'm back that wasn't fun"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,662.64,"i had to go make an alchemical table to"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,665.2,"get all this covalence dust it wasn't"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,667.279,"fun but you know what we're back we had"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,668.72,"to do all this with the draconic core i"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,670.8,"already had all that ah crap all right"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,672.48,"hold on let me get yeah we got that we"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,673.76,"got that and then i changed the medium"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,675.68,"into high and it was real easy okay so"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,678.399,"let's put the low"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,679.92,"in here and let's get a bunch of that"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,682.0,"now i need red matter which is 714 milli"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,685.2,"or 714 000 emc i can crap that out oh"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,688.48,"that's right we need dark matter too to"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,690.48,"make the red matter what is already got"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,692.0,"the fuel block of diamond oh come on i"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,694.72,"can dump that out all right let's teach"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,696.32,"our table a block of diamond and a tie"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,698.16,"dude this is so sick we're just spawning"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,700.959,"in everything we need and we will become"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,703.839,"the richest on this earth"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,707.36,"all right we got that let's grab a stack"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,708.88,"of dot block and diamonds why not all"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,710.72,"right we got the dark matter let's teach"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,712.8,"that"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,713.68,"to this now let's pull out some of that"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,715.6,"46 dark matter okay and then let's put"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,718.639,"this in here and now we got red matter"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,720.639,"let's teach this to the table"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,722.639,"even better matter all right cool let's"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,724.72,"pull some of that out oh that is expel"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,726.32,"yeah it's 700 thousand let's put in our"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,727.68,"diamonds now 4 million thank you let's"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,729.68,"get some more dark matter thank you"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,730.88,"seven red matter neat now we should be"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,732.72,"able to craft this there we go okay we"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,734.32,"got that now now we need these basic"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,736.32,"controllers another 700 000 emc what is"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,739.279,"this basic controller what is this"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,741.76,"glowstone furnace and wait already got"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,744.079,"all that oh i don't have glowstone crap"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,745.839,"all right i got glowstone dust now i got"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,747.68,"glowstone let's teach both people these"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,750.079,"to the table there we go all right we"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,751.279,"got glowstone guys we are literally"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,752.88,"cheating we are just spawning stuff in"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,754.8,"look at that now i got the basic"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,756.32,"controller let's teach this to this"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,758.32,"there we go and get a bunch of these"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,760.56,"yeah we got 57 that seems fair"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,763.2,"all right now we have the now we need to"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,764.72,"make this so nine of these makes that"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,767.92,"let's make one of these put this in here"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,770.56,"and then grab two of them dude that is"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,772.32,"so broken we can already make a flower"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,775.44,"there we go"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,778.24,"all right so how this works look in my"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,781.12,"emc table we have 3.2 million emc"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,785.36,"whenever i place down this flower watch"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,788.56,"what happens"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,789.76,"look"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,790.8,"look it should be going"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,792.639,"hold on look"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,794.16,"look at it it's constantly going up"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,798.32,"and i can just go afk all throughout the"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,801.6,"week it's constantly growing and i can"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,804.0,"just upgrade this there like i said"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,805.92,"there's level 15 that i can get to oh"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,809.04,"you could look in the top left i didn't"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,810.639,"even notice that you can see it's it's"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,812.959,"it's uh adding to the top left up there"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,815.279,"oh that is cool that is cool"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,817.68,"let me put some light down here i don't"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,819.12,"know if light makes it go faster i'm not"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,821.839,"sure but you know what we got it all"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,823.199,"right now i need to work on getting a"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,825.68,"ton of these and upgrade them fully so"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,828.959,"we become a billionaire and i also need"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,831.36,"to hide my base uh"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,834.24,"so i was running by and i you know i i"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,837.04,"remember that this was built a while ago"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,839.04,"this nuclear reactor right"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,841.199,"and as i was running by look in the door"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,846.72,"i'm pretty sure this is jerome's"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,850.959,"look at this he has 10 of them right but"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,855.04,"that's not all"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,857.36,"okay so i don't know if this works this"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,860.0,"is this is called"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,861.519,"hold on yeah i just turned it off can i"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,863.839,"take this off"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,865.44,"does it work this is this speeds up time"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,868.56,"right this makes like items around it go"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,871.519,"faster does this make these things"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,874.079,"produce more power i legitimately have"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,876.079,"no clue let me test it i'm gonna go"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,877.279,"steal it hold on sorry jerome thank you"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,879.199,"hold on let me test this okay let's put"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,880.88,"this down put this here look in the top"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,882.959,"left i'm gonna right click it see if it"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,884.399,"works"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,887.199,"it went from 20 to 387."
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,891.36,"if i can steal this"
IO6y4TxZZ7Q,893.839,"hold on"

iP_F_k2rtpg,447.759,"different colors with different rarities"
iP_F_k2rtpg,449.68,"the most rare being golden and items"
iP_F_k2rtpg,452.08,"also have a small chance of being shiny"

iP_F_k2rtpg,468.72,"players to get these items so i went"
iP_F_k2rtpg,470.8,"with a simple approach where at the end"
iP_F_k2rtpg,472.479,"of a round crowd boxes are dropped"
iP_F_k2rtpg,474.16,"randomly and you can open them for free"
iP_F_k2rtpg,475.919,"to get items"
iP_F_k2rtpg,481.44,"i'm pretty happy with how the cosmetics"
iP_F_k2rtpg,483.12,"turned out and it's also kind of"
iP_F_k2rtpg,484.4,"fascinating to see how the marketplace"

JGiMLAkdhgo,4.29,"I'm the producer of Dragon Ball Legends, TOSHI."
JGiMLAkdhgo,7.45,"And with me today..."
JGiMLAkdhgo,8.45,"Hello, everyone!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,9.76,"I'm the advertising producer, KAI."
JGiMLAkdhgo,11.98,"Thanks for having me."
JGiMLAkdhgo,13.45,"So, this is the first Video & Stuff for the New Year!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,16.55,"Mhm! Happy New Year's, everyone."
JGiMLAkdhgo,19.069,"First off, I'd like to thank everyone that played Legends last year."
JGiMLAkdhgo,23.159,"Both the management and development teams are working very hard to ensure"
JGiMLAkdhgo,26.659,"that all of you have a fantastic time playing this year as well."
JGiMLAkdhgo,30.819,"The Legends Festival that started last year is just about to wrap up,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,35.899,"so why don't we look back on it for a bit?"
JGiMLAkdhgo,39.24,"Of course."
JGiMLAkdhgo,40.28,"For this Legends Festival, we brought a number of large updates with brand new features."
JGiMLAkdhgo,44.94,"Also, we introduced our first Tag Character as well as the first Summonable ULTRA character,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,51.55,"so there's been a lot of new firsts."
JGiMLAkdhgo,53.829,"In particular, I think the addition of Tag Characters"
JGiMLAkdhgo,57.329,"has added a whole new level of strategy to Legends."
JGiMLAkdhgo,60.739,"While we've got our big 4-year anniversary coming up this May,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,64.43,"we're hoping that everyone got to experience a brand new and exciting Legends this festival."
JGiMLAkdhgo,69.03,"Of course, that meant new characters, as well as tons of new exciting Events that"
JGiMLAkdhgo,73.32,"you've come to expect from Legends!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,75.04,"It's also easier to claim the rewards of the Tournament of Power mode"
JGiMLAkdhgo,79.52,"and Rating Matches, so there's also been a lot of big quality-of-life updates"
JGiMLAkdhgo,84.67,"that I think, and hope, a lot of players appreciated."
JGiMLAkdhgo,87.88,"I think so too!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,89.799,"We're always working to make Legends more fun to play,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,93.61,"so please look forward to what we have in store for you this year!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,97.289,"But now, we have to move on"
JGiMLAkdhgo,99.397,"because we have new Legends info to share!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,102.67,"And first is..."
JGiMLAkdhgo,108.898,""The Elegant Android", an Event where you can get Android #21, is back!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,114.149,"Android #21 is an original character from Dragon Ball FighterZ,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,118.49,"but she's quite popular in Legends, isn't she?"
JGiMLAkdhgo,121.17,"She is! If you've just started playing during the Legends Festival,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,125.0,"or you just haven't gotten her yet, use this chance to add her to your roster!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,130.11,"Up next..."
JGiMLAkdhgo,135.98,"Android #21: Evil will finally Zenkai Awaken!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,138.73,"This is great news for everyone who uses Android parties!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,143.83,"It really is!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,145.14,"We're planning to have her Zenkai Ability strengthen characters who are both PUR and Android,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,149.861,"as well as boost her toughness and make her a more reliable character!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,154.91,"We'll talk more about her abilities at a later date!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,158.17,"Please try out this new and improved Android #21: Evil!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,163.27,"On to our next topic..."
JGiMLAkdhgo,169.23,"The World Challenge Raid"
JGiMLAkdhgo,170.666,"is back this month!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,171.91,"This time, the Boss is none other than 1st Form Frieza!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,176.23,"Even though we held so many Raids during the Legends Festival,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,180.29,"we're still going to have another one!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,182.5,"I used too many Chrono Crystals during the Legends Festival, so this will really help."
JGiMLAkdhgo,187.42,"Yeah, of course there will be Chrono Crystals available, but you can also get a bunch of other items as well,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,193.188,"so please don't let this Event pass by!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,195.87,"That's all the news we have about new in-game Events,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,198.82,"but we still have more to talk about!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,205.605,"The official Legends social media accounts have passed 1 million followers worldwide!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,210.98,"1 million is an incredible milestone for all of us."
JGiMLAkdhgo,214.07,"And it's thanks to all of you who have been playing Dragon Ball Legends."
JGiMLAkdhgo,217.59,"It really is!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,219.15,"Thank you so much, everyone!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,220.58,"And,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,221.198,"to celebrate passing 1 million followers, we're planning to hold an SNS campaign!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,226.11,"Please have a look!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,228.51,"Because 1 million followers is such a great achievement,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,232.21,"the rewards for this campaign will be a little different."
JGiMLAkdhgo,234.93,"We're preparing something special for everyone."
JGiMLAkdhgo,237.29,"Please check our social media accounts for more details at a later date,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,242.32,"and please give us a follow while you're there"
JGiMLAkdhgo,245.796,"if you haven't already!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,247.76,"And that's all the info we have on new Events!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,251.44,"It's time for what you've all been waiting for!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,254.74,"It's finally time!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,256.34,"Everyone, please take a look at this!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,354.71,"LEGENDS LIMITED Bardock is coming to Legends!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,357.759,"The long-awaited LL Bardock is here!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,360.99,"Yes! Since last year, we've been hearing from a lot of players"
JGiMLAkdhgo,364.569,"saying how much they wanted this Bardock,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,367.041,"so we're really glad we finally got to announce him today!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,370.349,"Could you tell us about his abilities?"
JGiMLAkdhgo,372.93,"Of course!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,374.22,"I won't be able to go into too much detail, but here we go!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,378.599,"LEGENDS LIMITED Bardock has incredible comeback potential,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,382.06,"making him really useful in longer battles."
JGiMLAkdhgo,384.53,"When he receives an enemy attack, his next inflicted damage and draw speed gets buffed."
JGiMLAkdhgo,390.49,"He'll also inflict all enemies with "No Switching" for a short time,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,394.71,"meaning you can unleash a powerful counterattack."
JGiMLAkdhgo,397.49,"Also, when an ally is defeated,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,399.692,"he nullifies the effects of Elemental disadvantage on any damage he receives."
JGiMLAkdhgo,404.46,"He also has a one-time health recovery effect that activates when his health reaches 0,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,409.659,"so you can use him to turn the tides of battle even when things are looking grim."
JGiMLAkdhgo,414.72,"His other abilities, like his special Cover Change against Blast Arts"
JGiMLAkdhgo,418.969,"and his ability to nullify his enemy's special Cover Changes,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,423.4,"make him the type of amazing offensive and defensive character"
JGiMLAkdhgo,426.509,"that you'd expect from LEGENDS LIMITED."
JGiMLAkdhgo,429.31,"He's everything you'd look for in a LEGENDS LIMITED character!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,433.34,"And there's one thing that I noticed."
JGiMLAkdhgo,435.689,""Solid State Scouter" was playing during the video, wasn't it?"
JGiMLAkdhgo,439.629,"That's right!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,440.68,"For this video, we used "Solid State Scouter""
JGiMLAkdhgo,443.447,"from the "Dragon Ball Z: Bardock – The Father of Goku" anime,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,447.95,"but the song will also play in game for a limited time."
JGiMLAkdhgo,451.34,"I'm sure it will get everyone pumped for battle."
JGiMLAkdhgo,455.09,"I really love that song."
JGiMLAkdhgo,456.794,"It has a lot of energy, but you can also sense a kind of sadness in it."
JGiMLAkdhgo,462.599,"You can't have Bardock without this song."
JGiMLAkdhgo,465.009,"I hope everyone turns up the music and enjoys this addition to the game!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,469.27,"But wait!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,470.27,"We have one more thing to show everyone today!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,472.3,"Please, have a look at this!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,475.199,"There are quite a few characters on screen!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,478.25,"What exactly is going on here?"
JGiMLAkdhgo,479.949,"So, I can't say too much right now,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,482.767,"but it's a brand-new game mode that's currently in development!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,486.99,"What do you guys think this new mode will be about?"
JGiMLAkdhgo,489.52,"I hope you all have fun speculating and look forward to when it releases!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,493.958,"Before we wrap up, I have one more announcement."
JGiMLAkdhgo,497.96,"We're currently running a survey on the Legends Festival,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,500.65,"so please take the time to answer it if you haven't already!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,505.18,"You can access it from the in-game News!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,507.639,"Also, everyone who answers the survey will get Chrono Crystals"
JGiMLAkdhgo,510.999,"as thanks for your valuable feedback!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,513.96,"And that is the end of today's Video & Stuff!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,516.54,"TOSHI, do you have any final words?"
JGiMLAkdhgo,519.218,"I just wanted to say"
JGiMLAkdhgo,520.247,"we will be working our hardest to make sure that Legends"
JGiMLAkdhgo,523.329,"is even more fun for everyone in 2022!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,526.651,"And I also hope you'll continue playing this year as well!"
JGiMLAkdhgo,530.31,"That's all from us today,"
JGiMLAkdhgo,531.576,"but I hope to see you guys next time!  Thanks! Bye, guys."

jgSRTx9e8hM,503.68,"fight he came up against the guy who"
jgSRTx9e8hM,505.68,"beat him and he stopped them i believe"
jgSRTx9e8hM,508.16,"in the second round and when he did that"
jgSRTx9e8hM,510.479,"he did that because he was calm francis"
jgSRTx9e8hM,513.039,"he took his time he was cautious but at"
jgSRTx9e8hM,515.76,"the same time he was aggressive it"
jgSRTx9e8hM,517.68,"wasn't overly aggressive i credited that"
jgSRTx9e8hM,519.599,"to his team and also to having kamaru in"
jgSRTx9e8hM,521.839,"his corner because kamara was reminding"
jgSRTx9e8hM,523.44,"him to stay calm that championship medal"

jgSRTx9e8hM,534.56,"the"
jgSRTx9e8hM,535.279,"the technical ability i feel technical"
jgSRTx9e8hM,538.16,"advantage over francis from what i've"
jgSRTx9e8hM,540.48,"seen so far in their previous fights but"
jgSRTx9e8hM,542.72,"francis got that equalizer francis got"
jgSRTx9e8hM,545.12,"their equalizer it's got that nuke and"
jgSRTx9e8hM,547.44,"all limbs i won't even just say his"
jgSRTx9e8hM,549.44,"hands and all limbs but he prefers to"
jgSRTx9e8hM,550.959,"use his hands like when his hands touch"
jgSRTx9e8hM,552.56,"his people they just they just fall it's"
jgSRTx9e8hM,555.12,"just that's just a thing so that's one"
jgSRTx9e8hM,556.959,"thing that i feel like gunn and this"
jgSRTx9e8hM,559.279,"team will have to be really careful"
jgSRTx9e8hM,560.64,"about is not getting trapped if francis"
jgSRTx9e8hM,562.959,"is patient and gets into a position"
jgSRTx9e8hM,565.36,"where guns isn't able to move you know"
jgSRTx9e8hM,568.0,"francis can touch him especially if he's"
jgSRTx9e8hM,569.44,"patient because you can only dodge for"
jgSRTx9e8hM,571.2,"so long you can't dodge forever even i"
jgSRTx9e8hM,573.12,"know this and i like to slip and"
jgSRTx9e8hM,574.959,"you know and dodge punches and stuff"
jgSRTx9e8hM,576.959,"because it's it's a probability thing"
jgSRTx9e8hM,579.519,"it's not if it's when you get caught so"
jgSRTx9e8hM,581.6,"you have to minimize that with other"
jgSRTx9e8hM,583.04,"ways so yeah francis just has to be"
jgSRTx9e8hM,584.88,"patient uses leg kicks uses faints these"
jgSRTx9e8hM,588.16,"are all things that cyril uses very well"
jgSRTx9e8hM,589.839,"as well like this is going to be an"
jgSRTx9e8hM,590.959,"interesting fight i should look forward"
jgSRTx9e8hM,592.24,"to because i've seen them spar as well"
jgSRTx9e8hM,593.36,"you look at the spine footage"
jgSRTx9e8hM,595.12,"it was a bit sloppy from what i saw"
jgSRTx9e8hM,597.279,"on both parties or did the coach release"
jgSRTx9e8hM,599.2,"it yeah okay i think it's petty if you"
jgSRTx9e8hM,601.2,"release the sparring footage i think"
jgSRTx9e8hM,602.72,"it's also a calculated move on his part"
jgSRTx9e8hM,604.8,"to try and like mind games and also"
jgSRTx9e8hM,606.88,"control the narrative but one thing i"
jgSRTx9e8hM,608.32,"know about francis is even when we talk"
jgSRTx9e8hM,610.16,"to him he's calm and he's not a guy that"
jgSRTx9e8hM,612.64,"like exudes fear of any kind and he's"
jgSRTx9e8hM,615.68,"very soft-spoken as well he's very soft"
jgSRTx9e8hM,617.519,"spoken about everything man it's gonna"
jgSRTx9e8hM,619.6,"be a crazy fight but this is this fight"
jgSRTx9e8hM,621.68,"honestly for me is bigger than the ufc"
jgSRTx9e8hM,623.519,"title this fight because we all know now"
jgSRTx9e8hM,625.279,"it's public knowledge what's happening"
jgSRTx9e8hM,626.56,"within with with francis and the ufc and"
jgSRTx9e8hM,628.72,"france is coming out saying i'm not"
jgSRTx9e8hM,630.72,"fighting for 500k or 600k anymore i mean"
jgSRTx9e8hM,633.76,"he and myself have had conversations"
jgSRTx9e8hM,636.72,"you know about that kind of stuff and as"
jgSRTx9e8hM,639.68,"the heavyweight champion of the world"
jgSRTx9e8hM,641.36,"shouldn't be fighting for that low"
jgSRTx9e8hM,643.6,"not at all should not be fighting for"
jgSRTx9e8hM,645.279,"that low because that just cheapens what"
jgSRTx9e8hM,647.2,"he's doing i mean look at his last fight"
jgSRTx9e8hM,649.04,"even his last fight before they made the"
jgSRTx9e8hM,650.56,"interim belt it wasn't even a few months"
jgSRTx9e8hM,653.76,"[ __ ]"
jgSRTx9e8hM,654.72,"jesus that had to do with a power move"
jgSRTx9e8hM,657.12,"you know to try and diminish"
jgSRTx9e8hM,659.44,"francis's accomplishments no it's"
jgSRTx9e8hM,661.36,"ridiculous after four months of being"
jgSRTx9e8hM,662.88,"the champion there's no way there should"
jgSRTx9e8hM,664.399,"be there should be an interim title"
jgSRTx9e8hM,665.839,"that's why i felt like it was you know"
jgSRTx9e8hM,667.279,"and not taking anything from surreal you"
jgSRTx9e8hM,669.44,"know great fighter cool dude but"
jgSRTx9e8hM,671.92,"there was no need for interim title this"
jgSRTx9e8hM,673.76,"should have just been a fight as cyril"
jgSRTx9e8hM,675.76,"the challenger for the heavyweight crown"
jgSRTx9e8hM,678.72,"but i mean now they have interim titles"
jgSRTx9e8hM,680.56,"it kind of looks cool"
jgSRTx9e8hM,682.16,"with the posters and whatnot um if i was"
jgSRTx9e8hM,684.399,"surreal methods of victory footwork"
jgSRTx9e8hM,686.72,"that's going to be his saving grace"
jgSRTx9e8hM,688.56,"mixing it up and i mean mixing up as in"
jgSRTx9e8hM,690.48,"like even takedowns just to show"
jgSRTx9e8hM,692.56,"something else and just mixing up his"
jgSRTx9e8hM,694.399,"strikes as well but yeah footwork is"
jgSRTx9e8hM,696.079,"going to be key though never getting"
jgSRTx9e8hM,698.56,"trapped along the fence francis methods"
jgSRTx9e8hM,701.44,"to victory staying calm staying patient"
jgSRTx9e8hM,703.839,"faints but you have to do the right"
jgSRTx9e8hM,705.839,"things not just the same face you have"
jgSRTx9e8hM,707.44,"to mix the faints up as well and also"
jgSRTx9e8hM,709.519,"mix up his attacks leg kicks would be"
jgSRTx9e8hM,711.92,"[ __ ] if he can just get a snappy leg"
jgSRTx9e8hM,713.68,"kicks"
jgSRTx9e8hM,714.56,"to take away surreal's footwork that"
jgSRTx9e8hM,716.32,"would be awesome early on go up top go"
jgSRTx9e8hM,718.24,"low papa inside leg kicks cause he's"
jgSRTx9e8hM,720.8,"gonna think like even if he checks it"

jv_eRNCuEvw,20.9,"scene and the attacker is going to come"
jv_eRNCuEvw,24.05,"in and it's going to jump into bed and"
jv_eRNCuEvw,26.0,"try to choke the victim this could be a"
jv_eRNCuEvw,28.64,"choking this could be an attempted rape"
jv_eRNCuEvw,30.23,"it could be a number of things but let's"
jv_eRNCuEvw,31.939,"take a look at what it might look like"
jv_eRNCuEvw,33.23,"in the bed first and then we'll come"
jv_eRNCuEvw,35.75,"back and we'll show you what the"
jv_eRNCuEvw,36.829,"techniques are breaking down pretty"
jv_eRNCuEvw,57.32,"scary situation obviously let's take a"
jv_eRNCuEvw,59.93,"look at the techniques that she"
jv_eRNCuEvw,61.159,"performed that will break him down one"
jv_eRNCuEvw,63.11,"step at a time so I was in this position"
jv_eRNCuEvw,65.96,"and I was choking okay immediately as I"
jv_eRNCuEvw,70.549,"went to make the choke she was striking"
jv_eRNCuEvw,73.159,"she started using her hands now if you"
jv_eRNCuEvw,75.29,"remember she was striking first up into"
jv_eRNCuEvw,77.299,"the eyes with a straight hand but a"
jv_eRNCuEvw,79.85,"straight fingers break into the eyes and"
jv_eRNCuEvw,81.65,"then she came back again and she struck"
jv_eRNCuEvw,83.69,"again into the throat of the flat fish"
jv_eRNCuEvw,85.7,"strike which we described it earlier"
jv_eRNCuEvw,87.58,"okay that pretty much loosened me up and"
jv_eRNCuEvw,90.229,"if L strikes were really well well"
jv_eRNCuEvw,91.94,"targeted it might be enough at this"
jv_eRNCuEvw,94.43,"point she brought her hands up over a"
jv_eRNCuEvw,95.84,"head thrust at the elbows and locked"
jv_eRNCuEvw,97.97,"down on my wrists hard and that did a"
jv_eRNCuEvw,100.88,"couple things that actually poked my"
jv_eRNCuEvw,102.38,"hands off her throat but a lot plain"
jv_eRNCuEvw,104.42,"hands down making the hard for me to"
jv_eRNCuEvw,107.03,"stabilize myself left and right the next"
jv_eRNCuEvw,110.18,"thing that happened is she used her legs"
jv_eRNCuEvw,111.92,"and drove in and drove me off to the"
jv_eRNCuEvw,115.19,"side she even used her hand to assist"
jv_eRNCuEvw,116.99,"and I fell over on my side she came up"
jv_eRNCuEvw,120.409,"and punched into my groin and then again"
jv_eRNCuEvw,123.439,"she needed to my groin several times"
jv_eRNCuEvw,125.869,"straight in into the groin and then was"
jv_eRNCuEvw,129.17,"able to roll the other direction and to"
jv_eRNCuEvw,132.17,"escape while I was recovering okay so"
jv_eRNCuEvw,137.049,"and so I said to our situation with a"
jv_eRNCuEvw,139.76,"choke in the bed"

jwa-_mw3-Jk,0.08,"i'll be honest with you typically when a"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,2.08,"brand brings out a set of irons with the"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,4.799,"same name as their brand new driver i am"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,8.24,"not a big fan for example when taylor"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,10.719,"may bring out an m5 driver guess what"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,12.88,"they bring out a set of m5 irons and"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,15.759,"typically i don't like them for a couple"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,17.359,"of reasons one i just think it's a"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,19.039,"little bit lazy like you know they're"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,21.199,"going to bring out a set of irons that"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,22.4,"match the driver and also the following"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,24.64,"year you pretty much know they're going"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,26.96,"to be replaced by the new named driver"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,30.64,"irons"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,32.0,"however"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,33.04,"this year"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,34.16,"i'm thinking a little bit differently"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,35.84,"because taylormade had brought out a new"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,38.32,"set of irons which have really caught my"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,40.48,"eye and it's the same named irons as the"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,43.28,"stealth driver"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,45.08,"[Music]"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,49.6,"now side note i'm not saying a set of"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,51.68,"irons that come out that match the name"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,53.12,"of the driver are bad irons i just"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,55.44,"typically don't get very excited about"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,57.039,"testing them now as you might know"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,58.64,"taylormade this year brought out"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,59.84,"tailor-made stealth driver and it's"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,61.92,"everywhere you've seen it the red face"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,64.239,"carving this carbon that"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,66.4,"and as soon as i heard about them"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,68.0,"bringing out a stealth set of irons"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,71.119,"in my head i'll picture what they look"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,72.479,"like i fully expect some sort of red"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,74.159,"face to be honest i fully expect them to"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,75.759,"be packed full of carbon and to look"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,77.759,"like they were gonna date quickly"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,79.84,"i was wrong"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,81.36,"because when i saw them i was pleasantly"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,83.36,"surprised these are the brand new"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,85.04,"taylormade stealth irons and i've got to"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,87.68,"admit i think they look really really"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,90.32,"good this year and because i like the"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,92.24,"look of them and i'm quite excited about"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,93.6,"them this time i'm gonna give them a"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,94.479,"test i'm gonna jump on the golf course"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,96.479,"i've got a five seven nine and picture"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,98.96,"wedge in the bag and these irons this"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,101.439,"year are very much aimed for the average"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,103.68,"golfer"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,104.72,"ultimate distance ultimate forgiveness"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,107.28,"uh they are powerful quite strong lofted"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,109.92,"and when i say strong lofted the seven"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,111.52,"iron is 28 degrees i mean that's closer"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,114.799,"to my five iron let's be honest so i'm"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,116.799,"expecting these to go a long way i'm"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,118.719,"going to play a few holes just see how"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,119.84,"they feel see what i think about them"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,122.159,"are they as good as they look because"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,124.24,"typically"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,125.6,"if you're a higher handicapper and you"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,127.2,"want a forgiving set of irons typically"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,129.599,"you get"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,130.8,"served the ugly looking golf clubs let's"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,133.599,"be honest but these claim to be"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,135.76,"forgiving for the higher handicapper but"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,137.92,"they look this good that could be a"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,139.76,"winning formula i'm gonna start with the"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,141.84,"five iron play a few holes see how they"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,144.16,"are"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,148.72,"ah"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,149.92,"um"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,150.879,"not the best start"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,152.4,"that might have ended up in the trees"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,155.12,"let's get down there that just goes to"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,156.879,"show doesn't matter how forgiving a set"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,158.48,"of irons are when you step up onto a"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,160.48,"first tee with a five iron in your hand"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,162.879,"and no practice swings"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,164.64,"anything can happen"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,166.239,"and uh"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,167.44,"that wasn't a good golf shot at all"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,169.84,"right bad news i couldn't find it so i'm"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,171.76,"gonna have to drop one and you know what"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,173.68,"i think it's only fair let me just play"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,176.0,"i'm gonna play a few holes hit loads of"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,177.519,"shots"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,178.879,"warm up a little bit get used to these"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,180.48,"irons see what i think"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,182.88,"[Music]"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,202.8,"okay so i've hit plenty of warm-up shots"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,204.48,"now now on that last tee i've just hit"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,208.56,"nine iron"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,209.84,"seven iron and five iron first thing i'm"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,213.04,"really impressed with they're all in a"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,215.44,"straight line down the fairway in fact"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,217.12,"come have a look at this"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,219.04,"so the first golf ball is over to nine"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,220.959,"then we move on to the seven and the"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,222.48,"final one down there's the five they're"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,224.159,"all in line with that flag that's pretty"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,226.48,"impressive didn't expect to see that but"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,228.48,"they are straight in line now"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,230.56,"what i do want to test because i hit all"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,233.2,"those three very similar to each other"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,235.2,"quality wise"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,236.799,"in theory"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,238.56,"each of these golf balls with them being"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,240.239,"two clubs apart should roughly be 24"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,244.4,"yards apart"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,246.0,"now my biggest concern about strong"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,248.959,"lofty golf clubs is the stronger lofted"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,252.0,"clubs i either five irons can sometimes"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,255.28,"go outrageously longer"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,257.359,"so let's see this test i'm gonna paste"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,259.68,"it out and see what the difference is"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,261.6,"this is nine iron like a decent distance"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,263.52,"off the tee"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,266.96,"18 yards from nine to seven that gap's a"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,270.8,"little bit too small"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,273.919,"and then from seven to five iron it's"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,276.88,"actually really good 25 yards"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,280.32,"that's about spot on"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,283.04,"so that kind of makes me think maybe the"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,285.84,"more lofty clubs are almost too strong"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,288.639,"like that gap between nine and seven"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,290.4,"isn't enough but from seven to five it's"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,292.88,"very good something to be aware of"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,295.04,"because as soon as you start going"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,295.919,"strong or lofted you definitely need"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,298.0,"more lofty clubs in your bag you need"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,299.44,"more wedges right let's hit these into"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,301.36,"the green"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,303.6,"oh that looks nice"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,305.84,"get up"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,307.12,"oh not bad not bad at all maybe a"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,309.84,"fraction short"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,311.6,"okay we have to jump on this nine iron a"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,313.44,"little bit to get it there"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,317.36,"but it's online"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,319.68,"get up to the back"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,321.919,"yeah maybe just a little bit short on"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,323.44,"that one okay pitching wedge into the"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,325.52,"green now"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,329.039,"so if it stays there that should be good"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,334.32,"go on"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,335.68,"that's good okay i know i've not"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,338.96,"absolutely loads of shots yet"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,341.36,"but i've got to say i'm impressed with"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,342.639,"the set so far they look good they do"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,345.199,"behind the golf ball they're not too"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,346.479,"ridiculously offset they don't look"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,348.72,"oversized"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,350.479,"but yeah i still feel like they're"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,351.52,"giving me a lot of forgiveness i feel"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,353.44,"like they're giving me enough protection"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,354.8,"around the ball"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,356.16,"um feel-wise not the softest feel kind"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,359.36,"of come to expect that with an oversized"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,361.039,"golf club all in all so far so good"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,364.88,"however i'm not finished testing yet"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,367.199,"because i do have a few little concerns"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,369.199,"about these clubs so before i come on to"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,371.36,"the potential negatives of these irons i"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,373.759,"want to talk price"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,375.36,"for seven irons is 850"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,378.84,"pounds what do you think about that"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,380.8,"price i'd love to know your thoughts"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,383.199,"down in the comments below okay so these"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,385.12,"are the three shots i just hit into the"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,386.479,"greens this one the last one was pretty"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,388.72,"good"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,389.52,"i've got to say i know the greens will"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,391.36,"be a little bit soft and receptive today"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,394.0,"they've all spun nicely"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,397.36,"it doesn't give me a lot to consider"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,398.56,"that it wouldn't stop on the green"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,399.919,"that's pretty impressive concern number"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,402.16,"one short game"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,403.919,"now whenever you're looking at buying a"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,405.759,"set of clubs that are stronger lofted"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,409.599,"for distance obviously all forgiveness"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,412.319,"i fear that sometimes you lose that"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,414.72,"little bit of finesse around the greens"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,416.96,"what a benefit of buying let's say a"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,419.44,"bladed iron or a forged iron or"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,421.68,"something with a little bit of cavity"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,423.039,"back with traditional lofts is you can"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,425.919,"have that little bit of flare around the"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,427.44,"green"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,428.479,"now with strong lofty golf clubs and"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,431.039,"certainly harder golf clubs sometimes"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,433.599,"you lose a bit of that feel now a lot of"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,435.68,"higher handicappers i would recommend to"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,437.28,"chip with like an eight or a nine iron"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,439.52,"but with strong lofty golf clubs they've"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,441.12,"got to be really using a pitching wedge"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,442.639,"because that is like a normal player's"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,444.56,"eight or nine iron so i'm gonna hit some"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,446.88,"shots from here just off the green with"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,448.16,"the wedge and just see how they feel"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,450.16,"like do you still get that feedback that"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,452.24,"you need for little delicate shots like"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,454.24,"this i'd say without me knowing that was"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,456.08,"a pitching wedge behind the ball that"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,458.0,"looks like my normal eight iron really"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,460.72,"but saying that on the spec it is 43"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,463.039,"degrees so it's not as if it's"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,465.039,"ridiculously strong it just looks it"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,466.96,"looks powerful"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,468.479,"all right i'll play a little almost like"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,469.84,"a bump and run shot with this"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,475.28,"go in"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,477.759,"well that wasn't a bad goal shot and"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,479.759,"it's just kept going i thought i'd"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,482.16,"played that really nicely"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,486.479,"slow down"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,488.319,"it's not too bad i'm gonna try and play"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,489.599,"this one a touch softer"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,493.759,"oh"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,494.639,"sit"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,495.68,"come on even softer"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,499.28,"just comes out so hot i'm really trying"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,501.36,"to play this"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,502.56,"soft and every single one is firing past"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,504.8,"the flag right i am definitely going to"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,507.039,"try and leave this one short of the flag"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,512.08,"and then i overcompensate it too much"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,514.8,"that goes exactly to my point"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,518.64,"said this for many years now whenever"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,520.64,"you've got strong lofts certainly with a"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,522.64,"big head size"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,524.48,"that's where i honestly feel like you do"

jwa-_mw3-Jk,529.12,"that finesse that you sometimes need on"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,530.959,"delicate little shots"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,532.64,"something definitely to be aware of and"

jwa-_mw3-Jk,539.76,"forgiving you can hit hot shots"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,542.8,"sometimes i might be stood hitting into"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,544.8,"a green i know this seven iron should go"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,546.48,"that distance and i just hit one bet and"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,548.72,"it comes off faster it might go 15 yards"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,551.44,"further you know i think i'd love to hit"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,553.44,"the ball 15 yards further you wouldn't"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,555.519,"do if it was out of bounds over the"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,556.72,"green or it's water over the green"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,559.2,"also on the flip side these irons are"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,561.279,"designed for ultimate forgiveness"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,563.519,"what they're gonna be like if i don't"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,564.72,"strike them well so i've come on to a"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,566.32,"par three here one of my favorite holes"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,567.92,"at the marriott"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,569.92,"i need five shots"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,571.839,"and whether i hit it good bad or"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,573.68,"indifferent"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,574.88,"in theory"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,577.04,"i should be able to find the green"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,579.04,"pretty safely"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,580.959,"okay"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,581.76,"shot number one"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,585.36,"that's a nice"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,587.04,"hit"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,589.15,"[Music]"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,591.279,"yeah that's good safely aboard the green"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,595.839,"that wasn't a good hit"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,598.08,"i hit that a little bit fat so if that"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,599.6,"gets on the green"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,601.6,"yeah that's done pretty well actually"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,603.2,"now one thing"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,604.48,"this pin isn't ideal for this club"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,607.04,"because these irons are quite upright"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,609.279,"they definitely have a favoritism to go"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,611.04,"left but i'm struggling to stop these go"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,613.6,"left i've seen it pretty much so far in"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,615.36,"the test something to be aware of if you"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,617.6,"are hitting them too far left they might"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,619.36,"not be the club for you"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,623.2,"that's it nice"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,624.959,"similar locations to the first two i"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,626.72,"think"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,629.04,"yeah again so far so good i can't get to"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,631.76,"this right pin though"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,633.44,"i'll try so what i've not seen yet is"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,636.0,"when i hit it really good"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,638.56,"because they are middle of the green"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,640.24,"towards back of the green"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,642.24,"i feel like if i absolutely crush one"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,645.279,"out the middle"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,646.399,"it has got the potential of going too"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,648.079,"long"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,650.5,"[Music]"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,652.24,"that could be that shot that felt right"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,654.959,"in the middle"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,656.56,"well"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,657.36,"i'm impressed okay"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,659.36,"final shot with the seven iron that"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,662.0,"grouping so far"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,664.0,"is pretty incredible"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,668.0,"i hit that really well i hit that really"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,670.56,"well"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,671.68,"is it gonna go"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,672.839,"big oh it did"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,677.279,"okay so now we're down to the green and"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,678.72,"let me evaluate these shots"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,681.04,"these three"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,682.56,"very very impressed like look at the"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,684.959,"line of those i was hitting from that"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,686.24,"direction they're all just past pin high"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,689.279,"but these are the three i hit"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,691.279,"nicely"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,692.72,"this one was interesting i didn't hit"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,694.959,"this one well i actually fatted it"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,697.12,"and to be honest i've not lost much"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,699.519,"distance at all in fact i bet it's only"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,701.36,"like two three"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,703.519,"four yards that's not a lot is it i'm"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,705.76,"happy with that"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,707.12,"on the last shot"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,709.04,"i hit better"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,710.8,"and it has gone slightly over the back"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,713.2,"of the green let me just show you"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,714.56,"something here this is the average base"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,716.88,"let's say one two three four five six"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,721.68,"seven eight the pitch mark is at eight"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,724.639,"and then it's kicked down"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,726.72,"so miss green yes"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,729.839,"would be brutal if i was to mark these"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,732.48,"irons down for a slight unfortunate kick"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,735.36,"off a good shot"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,736.959,"i have seen irons that definitely shoot"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,739.12,"much much longer that's a glimpse that"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,742.399,"these irons might do that on a really"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,745.6,"really center strike with a bit of low"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,747.519,"spin"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,748.399,"but overall"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,751.36,"for the first time"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,753.12,"in a long time"
jwa-_mw3-Jk,755.04,"i think these irons the stealth irons"

kU-M44tWm64,0.32,"the ash fall has been significant and"
kU-M44tWm64,3.12,"the tsunami waves have been destructive"
kU-M44tWm64,5.279,"but we don't know the extent of the"
kU-M44tWm64,7.52,"damage so the challenge is nobody is in"
kU-M44tWm64,10.8,"contact with anybody"
kU-M44tWm64,12.639,"on the island"
kU-M44tWm64,14.32,"and therefore we are all a bit in the"
kU-M44tWm64,16.96,"dark about exactly the scale of damage"
kU-M44tWm64,19.439,"or what people are experiencing so we"
kU-M44tWm64,21.439,"imagine one of the greatest needs is to"
kU-M44tWm64,24.16,"provide water purification and clean"
kU-M44tWm64,26.56,"drinking water we imagine that is"
kU-M44tWm64,28.08,"priority number one actually because of"
kU-M44tWm64,30.16,"the ash form"
kU-M44tWm64,34.88,"secondly anyone living in the coastal"
kU-M44tWm64,37.52,"areas may well have had their houses"
kU-M44tWm64,39.68,"damaged by the tsunami waves so shelter"
kU-M44tWm64,42.96,"is a second humanitarian concern and"
kU-M44tWm64,45.2,"because communications have been so"
kU-M44tWm64,47.2,"compromised"
kU-M44tWm64,48.719,"people will have lost contact with their"
kU-M44tWm64,50.239,"loved ones and therefore restoring those"
kU-M44tWm64,52.399,"family links"
kU-M44tWm64,53.6,"is a third priority for us it could be"
kU-M44tWm64,55.92,"with a population of around 100 000"
kU-M44tWm64,58.559,"and with 70 percent of them living on"

kU-M44tWm64,62.64,"heavily affected"
kU-M44tWm64,64.32,"we're roughly thinking up to 80 000"
kU-M44tWm64,66.4,"people could be affected"
kU-M44tWm64,68.08,"but how many of them are seriously"
kU-M44tWm64,69.84,"affected"
kU-M44tWm64,71.36,"we don't know"

kU-M44tWm64,79.84,"the underwater cable that appears to"
kU-M44tWm64,81.92,"have been damaged may not be fixed for"
kU-M44tWm64,83.92,"two or three weeks so full restoration"
kU-M44tWm64,86.24,"of contact is not close but mobile"
kU-M44tWm64,88.72,"phones might start working again in the"

lObhiNlkNdg,6.399,"two months driving over 3 000 miles from"
lObhiNlkNdg,9.36,"dallas through the rocky mountains for"
lObhiNlkNdg,11.12,"ski season and then we'll trade our skis"
lObhiNlkNdg,13.519,"for a surfboard as we drive all the way"
lObhiNlkNdg,15.519,"to the tip of the baja peninsula but"
lObhiNlkNdg,17.68,"before we take off we need to make some"
lObhiNlkNdg,19.039,"modifications to the van to get it ready"
lObhiNlkNdg,21.039,"for winter we got down to negative"
lObhiNlkNdg,23.6,"six last night and if all goes to plan"
lObhiNlkNdg,25.599,"by the end of this video we'll be"
lObhiNlkNdg,26.88,"sleeping by the slopes of new mexico i"
lObhiNlkNdg,28.8,"feel like this is the dreamy van life"
lObhiNlkNdg,30.24,"picture that everybody takes except it's"
lObhiNlkNdg,32.0,"real life right now"
lObhiNlkNdg,34.88,"i can't see where i'm going"
lObhiNlkNdg,41.44,"is that everything there's no way this"
lObhiNlkNdg,43.44,"is all fitting in there"
lObhiNlkNdg,46.399,"hey your helmet okay with"
lObhiNlkNdg,48.399,"like no padding"
lObhiNlkNdg,53.52,"this is what happens when you just leave"
lObhiNlkNdg,55.12,"a van sitting for two months it's all"
lObhiNlkNdg,57.12,"mobile"
lObhiNlkNdg,63.69,"[Music]"
lObhiNlkNdg,65.92,"good morning from the lowe's parking lot"
lObhiNlkNdg,68.96,"you're punching me in the face on"
lObhiNlkNdg,70.08,"purpose mm-hmm"
lObhiNlkNdg,81.52,"well"
lObhiNlkNdg,82.799,"as you can see we just threw everything"
lObhiNlkNdg,85.04,"in the car and started driving yesterday"
lObhiNlkNdg,86.72,"we drove for about six hours until we"
lObhiNlkNdg,88.32,"got to amarillo at midnight and slept"
lObhiNlkNdg,90.479,"here in this parking lot and if i had to"
lObhiNlkNdg,92.0,"guess this is where we're gonna be"
lObhiNlkNdg,93.28,"spending most of the day i'm typically"
lObhiNlkNdg,94.799,"like monica when it comes to living in"
lObhiNlkNdg,96.72,"the van everything monica"
lObhiNlkNdg,98.64,"from friends she's like super ocd if"
lObhiNlkNdg,100.799,"only there were a smaller one to clean"
lObhiNlkNdg,102.32,"this one but there just comes a time"
lObhiNlkNdg,104.32,"when the van gets so messy that it"
lObhiNlkNdg,106.399,"doesn't even bother me anymore i could"
lObhiNlkNdg,108.0,"barely get to the toilet this morning"
lObhiNlkNdg,110.56,"in addition to organizing our lives i"
lObhiNlkNdg,112.799,"also have three projects that i have to"
lObhiNlkNdg,115.119,"tackle today in order to get this van"
lObhiNlkNdg,116.799,"ready for winter although last night it"
lObhiNlkNdg,118.56,"was kind of already winter because when"
lObhiNlkNdg,119.759,"we woke up this morning it was 27"
lObhiNlkNdg,121.84,"degrees"
lObhiNlkNdg,123.6,"it's uh actually worse than it looks"
lObhiNlkNdg,125.36,"it's not just the stuff on the bed it's"
lObhiNlkNdg,127.119,"the stuff on the stove the stuff in the"
lObhiNlkNdg,128.8,"floor we even have stuff in the"
lObhiNlkNdg,130.399,"passenger floorboard the shower can't"
lObhiNlkNdg,132.56,"even get to the toilet the shirt and the"
lObhiNlkNdg,134.48,"sink where"
lObhiNlkNdg,136.16,"do we start"
lObhiNlkNdg,138.56,"let's do this"
lObhiNlkNdg,140.4,"okay"
lObhiNlkNdg,141.44,"so i think the first project on this"
lObhiNlkNdg,143.44,"list is gonna be the most important and"
lObhiNlkNdg,146.0,"the most complicated right now all of"
lObhiNlkNdg,147.84,"the water that drains down out of our"
lObhiNlkNdg,150.319,"sink it uh all flows into this five"
lObhiNlkNdg,153.04,"gallon gray water tank right here and"
lObhiNlkNdg,155.28,"because we're gonna be living in below"
lObhiNlkNdg,156.879,"freezing temperatures for the next few"
lObhiNlkNdg,158.4,"weeks this is just gonna turn into one"
lObhiNlkNdg,160.16,"giant ice block making it completely"
lObhiNlkNdg,162.4,"useless"
lObhiNlkNdg,164.08,"so i have to bring our gray water inside"
lObhiNlkNdg,166.319,"which is why i bought this blue bucket"
lObhiNlkNdg,168.08,"this is gonna be our new gray water tank"
lObhiNlkNdg,169.92,"the original plan was just to put it"
lObhiNlkNdg,171.519,"here"
lObhiNlkNdg,172.48,"where the fridge used to be and then i"
lObhiNlkNdg,173.76,"would divert the water from the sink"
lObhiNlkNdg,175.44,"into the blue bucket but this morning as"
lObhiNlkNdg,177.44,"i was staring at things i realized oh"
lObhiNlkNdg,180.48,"i was gonna try to re-wrap all the space"
lObhiNlkNdg,182.319,"under here and there's nowhere to run"
lObhiNlkNdg,184.4,"we've already drilled a hole through the"
lObhiNlkNdg,185.84,"bottom this is going to be easy and now"
lObhiNlkNdg,187.2,"i'm not even sure i can do it this is"
lObhiNlkNdg,188.72,"the propane box that just takes up this"
lObhiNlkNdg,190.4,"entire cabinet and this is where the"
lObhiNlkNdg,192.239,"water drains out of our sink so because"
lObhiNlkNdg,193.76,"of where the box sits there's no way"
lObhiNlkNdg,195.28,"that gravity would let water go that way"
lObhiNlkNdg,197.28,"the plan is to start by moving this box"
lObhiNlkNdg,200.08,"here"
lObhiNlkNdg,202.0,"all right don't drill a hole"
lObhiNlkNdg,204.799,"that was"
lObhiNlkNdg,206.0,"easy enough"
lObhiNlkNdg,208.0,"hanging out with eamon and seeing his"
lObhiNlkNdg,209.68,"willingness just to start ripping apart"
lObhiNlkNdg,211.519,"our van and figuring it out as he went"
lObhiNlkNdg,213.44,"gave me a little extra confidence to try"
lObhiNlkNdg,215.84,"to do some work on it by myself i'm not"
lObhiNlkNdg,217.44,"sure how i feel about that"
lObhiNlkNdg,221.2,"wow"
lObhiNlkNdg,222.799,"i love it when a plan actually works no"
lObhiNlkNdg,225.68,"problem i cannot believe that works"
lObhiNlkNdg,229.2,"so we've moved the propane box over here"
lObhiNlkNdg,231.28,"the blue jug fits underneath the sink"
lObhiNlkNdg,233.28,"now we need to do is figure out how to"
lObhiNlkNdg,234.72,"run this tube into this jug"
lObhiNlkNdg,245.12,"okay we haven't actually lived out of"
lObhiNlkNdg,247.2,"this van in almost two months for nate"
lObhiNlkNdg,249.76,"it's been like three i'm gonna start by"
lObhiNlkNdg,251.28,"putting away all of our normal stuff"
lObhiNlkNdg,253.28,"that we've moved back in here like our"
lObhiNlkNdg,254.879,"clothes and shoes and toiletries that"
lObhiNlkNdg,256.479,"already have a spot then i'll tackle all"
lObhiNlkNdg,258.959,"the extra stuff and figure out where"
lObhiNlkNdg,261.12,"that goes i still don't even know where"
lObhiNlkNdg,262.8,"to start"
lObhiNlkNdg,265.199,"i'm overwhelmed"
lObhiNlkNdg,266.56,"i don't even know what i'm looking for"
lObhiNlkNdg,268.08,"much less where to find it in the store"
lObhiNlkNdg,270.96,"oh this is crazy"
lObhiNlkNdg,272.88,"all right"
lObhiNlkNdg,274.43,"[Music]"
lObhiNlkNdg,275.84,"there's a chance i'm gonna be able to"
lObhiNlkNdg,277.12,"knock out one of these projects with"
lObhiNlkNdg,278.56,"just a six dollar pipe"
lObhiNlkNdg,280.96,"these are all of nate's shirts he is the"
lObhiNlkNdg,283.44,"definition of"
lObhiNlkNdg,285.52,"minimalists"
lObhiNlkNdg,291.759,"for select payment thank you for using"
lObhiNlkNdg,294.16,"low self checkout"
lObhiNlkNdg,298.24,"how's it going in here"
lObhiNlkNdg,300.16,"um"
lObhiNlkNdg,303.68,"it looks about the same i know"
lObhiNlkNdg,306.4,"i think this is all we need really"
lObhiNlkNdg,309.52,"i don't know okay don't seem so"
lObhiNlkNdg,311.919,"confident"
lObhiNlkNdg,314.72,"basically what i ended up doing was i"
lObhiNlkNdg,316.479,"unscrewed the original sink plumbing"
lObhiNlkNdg,318.24,"screwed a new flexible tube thing onto"
lObhiNlkNdg,321.919,"the bottom of the sink and i'm just"
lObhiNlkNdg,323.52,"gonna let the flexible tube thing drain"
lObhiNlkNdg,326.56,"directly into our new gray water bucket"
lObhiNlkNdg,328.479,"so i think i'm finished with project"
lObhiNlkNdg,329.6,"number one i didn't get near as fancy as"
lObhiNlkNdg,331.52,"i had planned but this is only a"
lObhiNlkNdg,333.12,"temporary solution and i think it's"
lObhiNlkNdg,335.039,"gonna work for now there's two hours of"
lObhiNlkNdg,336.479,"daylight left i've marked one thing off"
lObhiNlkNdg,338.0,"my list good job"
lObhiNlkNdg,340.08,"quick snack break we're getting angry"
lObhiNlkNdg,347.36,"shoot"
lObhiNlkNdg,350.96,"i believe we may have too much stuff in"
lObhiNlkNdg,352.639,"this thing"
lObhiNlkNdg,357.44,"what"
lObhiNlkNdg,359.6,"i just thought when i opened it up it"
lObhiNlkNdg,361.039,"was gonna be obvious what i needed to do"
lObhiNlkNdg,362.72,"the goal is to shut off all the water"
lObhiNlkNdg,364.479,"going to the shower because the plan is"
lObhiNlkNdg,366.479,"to turn the shower into a ski locker"
lObhiNlkNdg,368.24,"because we don't have any way to store"
lObhiNlkNdg,369.52,"the skis"
lObhiNlkNdg,370.56,"on the outside of the van which means"
lObhiNlkNdg,372.16,"the only place we can store him is in"
lObhiNlkNdg,373.919,"the shower so my goal is to disconnect"
lObhiNlkNdg,375.44,"the plumbing going to the shower so that"
lObhiNlkNdg,377.199,"nothing could freeze and burst inside"
lObhiNlkNdg,378.96,"the walls oh"
lObhiNlkNdg,380.4,"what is this so these definitely go to"
lObhiNlkNdg,382.639,"this"
lObhiNlkNdg,384.08,"i don't understand how plumbing works"
lObhiNlkNdg,386.479,"here's what we know so far this is a"
lObhiNlkNdg,388.24,"water tank this is a water pump"
lObhiNlkNdg,390.8,"this is a water heater and somehow"
lObhiNlkNdg,392.8,"they're all connected if this knob turns"
lObhiNlkNdg,395.52,"both of these pipes off and we think"
lObhiNlkNdg,397.6,"both of these pipes go to the shower"
lObhiNlkNdg,399.52,"then let's just turn them off and then"
lObhiNlkNdg,401.36,"turn the sink on and see what happens"
lObhiNlkNdg,408.319,"the sink seems to still work"
lObhiNlkNdg,415.44,"all right you ready"
lObhiNlkNdg,417.36,"so if water stops coming out of the"
lObhiNlkNdg,418.639,"shower in just a second that means we've"
lObhiNlkNdg,420.08,"broken it on purpose"
lObhiNlkNdg,423.12,"oh"
lObhiNlkNdg,424.24,"oh that's good is that it really yeah"
lObhiNlkNdg,427.039,"the pump is still pumping but no water"
lObhiNlkNdg,428.72,"is coming out whoa"
lObhiNlkNdg,430.72,"it turns out the guy who built this van"
lObhiNlkNdg,432.96,"installed a ball valve right here and"
lObhiNlkNdg,434.56,"just by flipping this little lever whoa"
lObhiNlkNdg,436.8,"just by flipping this little lever it"
lObhiNlkNdg,438.479,"cuts off the water to the shower that"
lObhiNlkNdg,439.919,"went a lot faster than project number"
lObhiNlkNdg,441.44,"one"
lObhiNlkNdg,442.319,"do you remember whose idea that was"
lObhiNlkNdg,446.319,"that was my idea you don't remember we"
lObhiNlkNdg,448.56,"were both looking at it no you're like i"
lObhiNlkNdg,451.28,"don't know where any of this goes and i"
lObhiNlkNdg,453.28,"said let's just turn them off and then"
lObhiNlkNdg,456.0,"turn the sync on and see what happens"
lObhiNlkNdg,458.56,"real quick we want to say a big thank"
lObhiNlkNdg,459.919,"you to athletic greens for sponsoring"
lObhiNlkNdg,461.52,"this video ag1 has been a part of our"

lObhiNlkNdg,470.56,"if we're living in the van we have this"
lObhiNlkNdg,472.16,"jar that we keep in the fridge but if"
lObhiNlkNdg,473.759,"we're traveling on an airplane we always"
lObhiNlkNdg,475.36,"bring plenty of these travel packs in"
lObhiNlkNdg,477.12,"our suitcase just one scoop of this"
lObhiNlkNdg,479.36,"contains 75 vitamins minerals and whole"
lObhiNlkNdg,482.16,"foods source ingredients so instead of"
lObhiNlkNdg,483.84,"having 75 different jars in my cabinet i"
lObhiNlkNdg,486.319,"just have this one even though we've"
lObhiNlkNdg,487.44,"been way more intentional about eating"
lObhiNlkNdg,489.039,"healthy lately just because we're always"
lObhiNlkNdg,491.199,"on the road or in the air it's still"
lObhiNlkNdg,492.72,"really hard to get all the vitamins and"
lObhiNlkNdg,494.08,"nutrients we need from our diet alone"
lObhiNlkNdg,495.84,"which is why we consider 821 our"
lObhiNlkNdg,497.919,"nutritional insurance it's the first"
lObhiNlkNdg,499.759,"thing i drink every single day after my"
lObhiNlkNdg,501.68,"morning coffee of course because then i"
lObhiNlkNdg,503.28,"know no matter what happens the rest of"
lObhiNlkNdg,504.8,"the day my body got the nutrients in me"
lObhiNlkNdg,507.039,"so if you could use some nutritional"
lObhiNlkNdg,508.56,"insurance of your own or if you made a"
lObhiNlkNdg,510.24,"new year's resolution to be healthier in"

lObhiNlkNdg,526.16,"these individual travel packs plus"
lObhiNlkNdg,527.92,"you'll get this jar and the shaker with"
lObhiNlkNdg,529.839,"your first purchase"
lObhiNlkNdg,533.04,"okay back to the video"
lObhiNlkNdg,538.399,"this morning cara filled my suitcase up"
lObhiNlkNdg,540.0,"with our wetsuits warm clothes bathing"
lObhiNlkNdg,542.72,"suits all the things that we aren't"
lObhiNlkNdg,544.16,"planning on needing it's all gonna go on"
lObhiNlkNdg,545.68,"this hole never to be seen again"
lObhiNlkNdg,549.12,"like a glove and now for the most"
lObhiNlkNdg,551.12,"exciting project of the day and"
lObhiNlkNdg,552.959,"hopefully the last one that we're going"
lObhiNlkNdg,554.16,"to knock out before pulling out of this"
lObhiNlkNdg,555.839,"parking lot and that is converting our"
lObhiNlkNdg,557.6,"current shower toilet into a ski locker"
lObhiNlkNdg,560.959,"and the plan for doing that is first to"
lObhiNlkNdg,562.72,"take this mat that we bought and pad the"
lObhiNlkNdg,564.56,"bottom of the shower so that way we can"
lObhiNlkNdg,566.0,"just throw our ski boots in there and"
lObhiNlkNdg,567.519,"they won't tear everything up then i"
lObhiNlkNdg,569.2,"bought these pads i'm going to try to"
lObhiNlkNdg,570.959,"hang these on the back wall so that our"
lObhiNlkNdg,573.12,"skis when they're hanging there they"
lObhiNlkNdg,574.72,"don't bang against everything as we're"
lObhiNlkNdg,576.32,"dropping yeah bro everything wet that"
lObhiNlkNdg,578.08,"you wouldn't want just like dripping on"
lObhiNlkNdg,579.279,"the floor of the van we're gonna try to"
lObhiNlkNdg,580.56,"store that in the shower so that when it"
lObhiNlkNdg,582.0,"drips it all just drains out the shower"
lObhiNlkNdg,583.76,"drain we'll probably use this ski locker"
lObhiNlkNdg,585.279,"way more than we ever actually use our"
lObhiNlkNdg,586.64,"shower anyway for sure"
lObhiNlkNdg,589.68,"so i feel like if we just"
lObhiNlkNdg,591.44,"push it in and then we'll just cut it"
lObhiNlkNdg,593.68,"out when it's already in place no it's"
lObhiNlkNdg,595.519,"cut a hole around the"
lObhiNlkNdg,597.12,"i feel lazy saying this but the other"
lObhiNlkNdg,599.04,"question is do we even need to cut it i"
lObhiNlkNdg,600.72,"don't think so because it kind of it"
lObhiNlkNdg,602.399,"just adds some extra protection to this"
lObhiNlkNdg,604.24,"side of the wall over here"
lObhiNlkNdg,609.04,"that was so easy we kind of nailed that"
lObhiNlkNdg,611.519,"i can't believe how well this is working"
lObhiNlkNdg,614.24,"cutting and pushing foam pieces into the"
lObhiNlkNdg,616.0,"shower fits my construction ability"
lObhiNlkNdg,618.48,"perfectly"
lObhiNlkNdg,622.72,"i mean it kind of worked it totally"
lObhiNlkNdg,624.8,"works so the wall is done for now all"
lObhiNlkNdg,626.64,"right so here's where we've ended up"
lObhiNlkNdg,627.92,"it's not complete yet but eventually"
lObhiNlkNdg,629.839,"once we get our skis and we can measure"
lObhiNlkNdg,631.2,"it appropriately"
lObhiNlkNdg,632.48,"we'll install the ski hangers okay we're"
lObhiNlkNdg,634.32,"going to mark it off because it's almost"
lObhiNlkNdg,635.44,"done"
lObhiNlkNdg,636.24,"more than halfway there so we've decided"
lObhiNlkNdg,638.16,"to add one more project to the list i"
lObhiNlkNdg,640.56,"ordered way too much of this padding"
lObhiNlkNdg,642.48,"stuff plus it's super cheap so we've"
lObhiNlkNdg,644.399,"decided we're just gonna go ahead and"
lObhiNlkNdg,645.92,"pad the entire floor one it's gonna help"
lObhiNlkNdg,648.0,"protect the vinyl wood stuff that we"
lObhiNlkNdg,650.399,"have going on down there and two the"
lObhiNlkNdg,652.399,"floor gets really cold so this will just"
lObhiNlkNdg,655.04,"give us an added layer of insulation and"
lObhiNlkNdg,657.279,"make it nicer to stand on the floor in"
lObhiNlkNdg,659.04,"socks in the morning"
lObhiNlkNdg,664.88,"this is the best thing we've done all"
lObhiNlkNdg,666.24,"day i haven't heard that enthusiasm all"
lObhiNlkNdg,668.24,"day"
lObhiNlkNdg,671.12,"this took it from like new york"
lObhiNlkNdg,672.959,"penthouse apartment vibes to ski lockers"
lObhiNlkNdg,675.76,"seriously one could change so much and"
lObhiNlkNdg,677.68,"it took like 30 minutes and"
lObhiNlkNdg,680.16,"when i take my shoes off"
lObhiNlkNdg,682.399,"my feet aren't cold i mean it looks like"
lObhiNlkNdg,684.0,"it's always been there and goes all the"
lObhiNlkNdg,685.36,"way back to under the bed and i feel"
lObhiNlkNdg,686.72,"like i'm not gonna care as much if it"
lObhiNlkNdg,688.16,"gets dirty like it's just supposed to be"
lObhiNlkNdg,690.24,"it's like rugged let's write it on the"
lObhiNlkNdg,692.079,"list and then mark it off let's do it"
lObhiNlkNdg,694.399,"oh yeah i should also write put away"
lObhiNlkNdg,697.04,"everything we own i mean look nothing"
lObhiNlkNdg,699.04,"else oh nevermind i'm just doing"

lObhiNlkNdg,703.76,"happening up front honestly getting that"
lObhiNlkNdg,705.839,"floor installed makes me feel so much"

lTpI5fWCKHQ,29.279,"of the frontal lobe arm chest all right"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,32.16,"so we're gonna do"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,32.96,"you're gonna make a frame all right so"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,34.399,"everyone knows"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,37.2,"right here you're not gonna muscle it"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,39.12,"you're not gonna slam on it"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,40.399,"like a jack hammer okay you wanna place"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,57.039,"you're not trying to use strength to"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,58.8,"pull his arms away"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,60.239,"you're using a force you are using your"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,62.16,"whole body using"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,63.68,"um everything you have right here you"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,65.28,"don't want to muscle it yeah"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,67.119,"you can't hustle it it doesn't work"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,69.92,"there are a lot of stronger"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,98.799,"i'm"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,106.72,"all right so that is um the first one"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,109.84,"we're gonna do"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,111.04,"second part all right so you'll see this"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,113.52,"a lot have a bigger"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,114.88,"film you haven't done it yet"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,117.92,"all right"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,121.68,"someone's up on top they decided choking"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,124.399,"you isn't going to work"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,125.439,"and they'd pin your arms down all right"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,128.56,"so this is you'll see this every once in"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,131.52,"a while on the street"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,132.64,"um they're kind of like i got you now"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,134.319,"right um what are you gonna do"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,136.08,"is all a lot of their weight and their"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,138.0,"strength is up here"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,140.319,"and then it's so you can off balance"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,143.599,"them"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,144.48,"very easily doing such something like"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,147.12,"that so"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,148.08,"i kind of think of this as snow angels"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,150.48,"whenever i do this"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,152.56,"um that helps me um get the form right"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,155.36,"what you're gonna do"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,156.16,"is you're going to circle out and down"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,159.44,"that displaces all their weight on top"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,161.76,"and out that way"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,162.72,"but you're going to pair that with a"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,164.56,"sweep all right"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,167.76,"all right so when you do this and that"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,170.56,"moment of off balance"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,171.92,"is when you um throw them over so you"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,173.519,"can do a bump and roll or you can do it"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,175.519,"so right here"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,179.12,"all right so basically why that works is"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,181.84,"because like i was saying before"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,183.519,"all their weight they have a lot of"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,185.76,"weight a lot of balance"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,187.36,"is put on your arms"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,190.48,"which is a very bad bad place for it to"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,192.319,"be is you can move those arms"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,194.48,"right so by circling them out or by"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,197.36,"shutting them"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,198.0,"straight up you're misplacing their"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,200.56,"balance and then that moment of being"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,202.239,"off balance is when you do this or"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,205.519,"above them so all right your time"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,211.44,"you know you wanted to right here make"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,213.92,"the gable grip make a frame"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,216.239,"um breathe in alright breathe out sorry"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,218.319,"um and pull in"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,219.28,"right here and come straight up into a"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,222.959,"good position"
lTpI5fWCKHQ,238.879,"all right get with your partners"
M8AA5_WOz4A,0.0,"concept of not letting yourself I'm"
M8AA5_WOz4A,3.09,"isolated right and so I'll tell a quick"
M8AA5_WOz4A,6.899,"quick story that's related to this one"
M8AA5_WOz4A,9.57,"of my co-workers when I was working at"
M8AA5_WOz4A,11.34,"Nike she confided to me once you found"
M8AA5_WOz4A,14.16,"out that I taught self defense and she"
M8AA5_WOz4A,17.07,"told me a story of how she got raped she"
M8AA5_WOz4A,20.609,"went to a party with some friends and it"
M8AA5_WOz4A,27.029,"was at someone's house and they were"
M8AA5_WOz4A,29.82,"playing extremely loud music right and"
M8AA5_WOz4A,33.29,"so she decided to leave for friends and"
M8AA5_WOz4A,39.719,"go use the restroom unfortunately there"
M8AA5_WOz4A,43.05,"was one person that was and this is more"
M8AA5_WOz4A,46.68,"of a stranger this is something she"
M8AA5_WOz4A,48.059,"didn't know but it kind of relates to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,50.55,"both kind of scenarios right because he"
M8AA5_WOz4A,53.67,"was looking for an opportunity to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,55.5,"isolate anybody any probably female I'm"
M8AA5_WOz4A,61.379,"guessing but so he was waiting right by"
M8AA5_WOz4A,65.22,"the bathroom door just sitting there"
M8AA5_WOz4A,67.909,"kind of hanging around right so when she"
M8AA5_WOz4A,72.99,"went to go into the bathroom which was"
M8AA5_WOz4A,75.299,"just a you know in-home so a single"
M8AA5_WOz4A,77.189,"bathroom as she went in he followed her"
M8AA5_WOz4A,81.42,"in and then he closed the door and"
M8AA5_WOz4A,84.09,"locked it right and that's the isolation"
M8AA5_WOz4A,86.97,"phase so we'll talk more about that"
M8AA5_WOz4A,90.78,"scenario later but that's how some"
M8AA5_WOz4A,93.03,"people want to try and get you isolated"
M8AA5_WOz4A,95.009,"so if you can so that's where"
M8AA5_WOz4A,98.7,"situational awareness is really"
M8AA5_WOz4A,100.77,"important noticing like why is this guy"
M8AA5_WOz4A,103.259,"hanging out by himself right by the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,105.63,"bathroom door that's a sign that you"
M8AA5_WOz4A,109.14,"should be careful you know"
M8AA5_WOz4A,119.909,"all right so phase two is what who"
M8AA5_WOz4A,123.579,"remembers what phase two is phase one is"
M8AA5_WOz4A,126.21,"identify an unsuspecting Vista so they"
M8AA5_WOz4A,129.009,"gotta look around like oh there is a"
M8AA5_WOz4A,130.929,"good victim because they're not paying"
M8AA5_WOz4A,133.93,"attention right so then what's the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,137.44,"defense against phase one pay attention"
M8AA5_WOz4A,141.34,"right look up let them know that you're"
M8AA5_WOz4A,144.569,"aware of the situation"
M8AA5_WOz4A,146.709,"right okay as best as possible now"
M8AA5_WOz4A,150.19,"because we live in the world world and"
M8AA5_WOz4A,152.14,"we get distracted and we're all humans"
M8AA5_WOz4A,154.66,"we might not always catch stuff so"
M8AA5_WOz4A,159.64,"that's why we need to learn how to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,161.2,"defend against phase 2 phase 2 is when"
M8AA5_WOz4A,164.11,"somebody actually makes physical contact"
M8AA5_WOz4A,165.73,"with you and we're gonna learn a whole"
M8AA5_WOz4A,168.16,"bunch of stuff how to do that next but"
M8AA5_WOz4A,170.53,"let's talk before we do that because"
M8AA5_WOz4A,171.88,"that'll take some time let's talk about"
M8AA5_WOz4A,173.709,"phase 3 what do you think phase 3 is"
M8AA5_WOz4A,176.17,"once they have control of you what is"
M8AA5_WOz4A,178.18,"their next phase yeah yeah"
M8AA5_WOz4A,186.89,"so let's go back to that story so my"
M8AA5_WOz4A,189.44,"friend is now in the bathroom but she's"
M8AA5_WOz4A,191.81,"not no longer alone she's stuck in there"
M8AA5_WOz4A,194.03,"with some crazy person right so what do"
M8AA5_WOz4A,199.67,"you think he did to her I mean the first"
M8AA5_WOz4A,203.93,"the next first thing he made contact"
M8AA5_WOz4A,206.42,"right right"
M8AA5_WOz4A,208.04,"made physical contact and so phase 3 is"
M8AA5_WOz4A,211.48,"try and exhaust the victim so they end"
M8AA5_WOz4A,215.9,"up down the floor and now they are kind"
M8AA5_WOz4A,221.03,"of yeah just and so she's fighting back"
M8AA5_WOz4A,227.72,"right she's trying to do whatever self"
M8AA5_WOz4A,230.84,"defense she can do you remember the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,233.06,"statistic about self defense statistics"
M8AA5_WOz4A,235.22,"I think it was like 70% of them are rape"
M8AA5_WOz4A,238.57,"yes 70% of all rape victims tried to do"
M8AA5_WOz4A,243.59,"some kind of form of self defense and"
M8AA5_WOz4A,245.06,"failed right so phase 3 is they want to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,249.92,"try and exhaust you right and it's just"
M8AA5_WOz4A,252.68,"like the same thing in the wild right"
M8AA5_WOz4A,254.33,"that's what prey does is like a lion"
M8AA5_WOz4A,256.669,"will do to a gazelle right they wait"
M8AA5_WOz4A,259.519,"until you're exhausted and so that's"
M8AA5_WOz4A,261.859,"what she did she fought back as much as"
M8AA5_WOz4A,263.81,"she could everything that she was doing"
M8AA5_WOz4A,266.3,"was fairly ineffective and she just got"
M8AA5_WOz4A,270.38,"exhausted right so after she completely"
M8AA5_WOz4A,273.74,"was exhausted had no more energy left"
M8AA5_WOz4A,275.66,"and of course she was screaming her"
M8AA5_WOz4A,277.13,"lungs out but nobody could hear her"
M8AA5_WOz4A,280.22,"because the music was so loud so that"
M8AA5_WOz4A,283.13,"was another indicator of like loud music"
M8AA5_WOz4A,287.27,"if I scream no one can hear me not a"
M8AA5_WOz4A,289.55,"good place to be so I hit the chin and I"
M8AA5_WOz4A,293.15,"hit the eyes"
M8AA5_WOz4A,298.29,"he's gonna be faster than me to get my"
M8AA5_WOz4A,301.2,"hand to his face I can see what works"
M8AA5_WOz4A,304.2,"we're just learning we're just learning"
M8AA5_WOz4A,306.03,"how to strike we're not this is"
M8AA5_WOz4A,307.89,"isolation so don't think about oh he's"
M8AA5_WOz4A,311.22,"gonna block this whatever just don't"
M8AA5_WOz4A,314.61,"think about that yet right tracing our"
M8AA5_WOz4A,316.47,"letters so I'm going to come in here I'm"
M8AA5_WOz4A,319.35,"going to hit up with the chin with a"
M8AA5_WOz4A,320.91,"palm strike and then this goes right"
M8AA5_WOz4A,323.22,"down into the eyes of course I'm going"
M8AA5_WOz4A,324.84,"to be shy of the eyes and I'm going to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,326.25,"take them straight down this way we're"
M8AA5_WOz4A,329.7,"gonna be hitting the ground this is how"
M8AA5_WOz4A,331.92,"you react right I'm gonna do on this"
M8AA5_WOz4A,335.01,"side and he's gonna go slow on me"
M8AA5_WOz4A,340.29,"because I'm older right so he's gonna do"
M8AA5_WOz4A,343.5,"it I'm still gonna fall but I'm gonna"
M8AA5_WOz4A,344.96,"I'm gonna react all right so you could"
M8AA5_WOz4A,349.68,"be nice to each other you don't have to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,351.0,"slam each other down yeah because you're"
M8AA5_WOz4A,356.67,"going like this and now all right so go"
M8AA5_WOz4A,362.34,"ahead and do that to each other try not"
M8AA5_WOz4A,364.17,"to get caught up in the scenario kind of"
M8AA5_WOz4A,366.3,"thing yet we'll get there right right"
M8AA5_WOz4A,368.52,"now we're just isolating learning how to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,370.35,"do certain things and then we'll put"
M8AA5_WOz4A,372.78,"them together and see how they kind of"
M8AA5_WOz4A,374.13,"work so we're gonna stick with the eyes"
M8AA5_WOz4A,376.02,"for a second we're gonna grab the back"
M8AA5_WOz4A,378.87,"of the neck like this this is my"
M8AA5_WOz4A,382.23,"favorite and we're gonna take our thumb"
M8AA5_WOz4A,384.78,"and poke it on the inside of the nose"
M8AA5_WOz4A,389.49,"right here and scoop out work you're"
M8AA5_WOz4A,391.8,"actually removing the eye when you do"
M8AA5_WOz4A,394.59,"this right and you do that okay second"
M8AA5_WOz4A,400.44,"orange so obviously if I did it like"
M8AA5_WOz4A,402.48,"this he's gonna back away back away"
M8AA5_WOz4A,405.33,"right so that's why I have to grab the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,407.61,"back of the neck and I bring them in"
M8AA5_WOz4A,409.08,"nice and tight"
M8AA5_WOz4A,409.92,"and I go here and you scoop out"
M8AA5_WOz4A,416.75,"you ever have you ever peeled an orange"
M8AA5_WOz4A,420.18,"that's that's how you so you don't peel"
M8AA5_WOz4A,422.61,"an orange with the patty or thumb you"
M8AA5_WOz4A,424.41,"peel it with your fingernail right yeah"
M8AA5_WOz4A,433.01,"just like that"
M8AA5_WOz4A,434.58,"obviously we go in the eye you go it"
M8AA5_WOz4A,436.62,"goes in and scoops all the way up like"
M8AA5_WOz4A,439.53,"going pearl diving right grabbing for"
M8AA5_WOz4A,442.35,"pearls all right right this guy's trying"
M8AA5_WOz4A,449.19,"to get you know like okay so obviously"
M8AA5_WOz4A,451.17,"this is not something that you try on"
M8AA5_WOz4A,452.85,"your kid brother like hey let me try"
M8AA5_WOz4A,455.43,"this on you right now and and then it's"
M8AA5_WOz4A,458.19,"first he's killing you and then he he's"
M8AA5_WOz4A,460.05,"killed three people in a row and you're"
M8AA5_WOz4A,462.33,"next right and then your daughter's next"
M8AA5_WOz4A,464.79,"after you like you're not gonna let"
M8AA5_WOz4A,466.53,"yourself die so that he can right so"
M8AA5_WOz4A,471.36,"that's the center you have to put"
M8AA5_WOz4A,473.37,"yourself in right and so so don't grab"
M8AA5_WOz4A,480.18,"this way because this would never work"
M8AA5_WOz4A,481.59,"right you you grab this way exactly so"
M8AA5_WOz4A,495.03,"we're not done with this but I want to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,496.35,"show one common mistake that people are"
M8AA5_WOz4A,497.97,"doing is they're they're not stepping"
M8AA5_WOz4A,500.88,"correctly they'll step here and reach"
M8AA5_WOz4A,502.56,"over and kind of grab them like this"
M8AA5_WOz4A,504.05,"right you need to be stepped through at"
M8AA5_WOz4A,509.28,"least have your toe past their heel okay"
M8AA5_WOz4A,514.7,"wait all right let's go one last one for"
M8AA5_WOz4A,519.39,"the groin you're gonna be on all fours"
M8AA5_WOz4A,522.36,"hands on knees all right I'm just gonna"
M8AA5_WOz4A,525.63,"be here and just go like this"
M8AA5_WOz4A,527.91,"Wow okay and then you do right left okay"
M8AA5_WOz4A,533.01,"go for it this is called kicking a man"
M8AA5_WOz4A,537.39,"while he's down"
M8AA5_WOz4A,538.64,"[Laughter]"
M8AA5_WOz4A,547.079,"okay yeah we'll do the scenario training"
M8AA5_WOz4A,550.68,"you're gonna end up in all weird"
M8AA5_WOz4A,552.759,"scenarios and you just need to be able"
M8AA5_WOz4A,554.889,"to know how to do this it's gonna cause"
M8AA5_WOz4A,556.69,"that effect of another injury that makes"
M8AA5_WOz4A,558.43,"sense you know I was explained Tori this"
M8AA5_WOz4A,560.11,"is not a starting point it's could be"
M8AA5_WOz4A,562.899,"going for that I gouge and they're"
M8AA5_WOz4A,564.009,"getting right back up yeah okay bring it"
M8AA5_WOz4A,567.129,"on in okay once again this is isolation"
M8AA5_WOz4A,571.949,"in a scenario all sorts of weird"
M8AA5_WOz4A,575.56,"positions are gonna occur you don't know"
M8AA5_WOz4A,578.17,"what the situation is you don't know it"
M8AA5_WOz4A,582.04,"could be lay down on the floor this is"
M8AA5_WOz4A,584.31,"one of your daughter's pretend this is"

M8AA5_WOz4A,598.839,"what to do right so don't get too caught"
M8AA5_WOz4A,601.899,"up in the scenarios because you just"
M8AA5_WOz4A,604.06,"need to learn stuff because these things"
M8AA5_WOz4A,606.009,"happen in all sorts of weird scenarios"
M8AA5_WOz4A,608.139,"and we can't think of all of them but"
M8AA5_WOz4A,610.66,"because you saw this once and you see it"
M8AA5_WOz4A,612.37,"for really like oh I know what to do in"
M8AA5_WOz4A,613.779,"this situation"
M8AA5_WOz4A,614.79,"does that make sense he can be on his"
M8AA5_WOz4A,619.0,"one knee like this yeah face up yeah"
M8AA5_WOz4A,623.759,"what can I do from here yes all right I"
M8AA5_WOz4A,627.279,"know what to do from here this is"
M8AA5_WOz4A,629.199,"perfect scenario alright so don't get"
M8AA5_WOz4A,634.209,"too caught up in them why would I ever"
M8AA5_WOz4A,635.86,"attack somebody like that just go with"
M8AA5_WOz4A,639.37,"it"
M8AA5_WOz4A,639.55,"right it'll happen it happens and that's"
M8AA5_WOz4A,642.579,"why we train and teach this because it"
M8AA5_WOz4A,644.649,"happens all the time right so we need to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,646.779,"know how to deal with those kind of"
M8AA5_WOz4A,648.55,"scenarios all right so that's the groin"
M8AA5_WOz4A,654.0,"we're going to go now to the ankles go"
M8AA5_WOz4A,657.43,"ahead and get back down on all fours"
M8AA5_WOz4A,658.99,"again"

M8AA5_WOz4A,667.54,"let me show it one more time real quick"
M8AA5_WOz4A,670.59,"so in a ideal situation I want to come"
M8AA5_WOz4A,675.22,"from it at this angle"
M8AA5_WOz4A,676.69,"come over here go to the opposite one"
M8AA5_WOz4A,678.94,"that's furthest away from me just keep"
M8AA5_WOz4A,680.71,"it up where it was for a second and I"

M8AA5_WOz4A,685.09,"go this way but I'm gonna just walk"
M8AA5_WOz4A,686.68,"through right there's gonna twist his"
M8AA5_WOz4A,688.99,"knee actually so it's going to tear that"
M8AA5_WOz4A,692.44,"it's gonna damage not just the ankle but"
M8AA5_WOz4A,694.54,"it's gonna probably twist as knee as"
M8AA5_WOz4A,696.76,"well so you want to put heel to heel"
M8AA5_WOz4A,698.94,"here and slowly put all your weight on"
M8AA5_WOz4A,702.85,"to it but if you go with speed"
M8AA5_WOz4A,706.26,"everything starts ripping apart right so"
M8AA5_WOz4A,710.32,"do this really slowly so that your"
M8AA5_WOz4A,712.12,"partner can go ahead of the curve so he"
M8AA5_WOz4A,714.34,"doesn't get injured but he's gonna come"
M8AA5_WOz4A,716.44,"in and attack just hear it make sense"
M8AA5_WOz4A,721.87,"you do either side doesn't matter right"
M8AA5_WOz4A,724.54,"in that ankle joint and I really want to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,726.22,"place this here and I want to shift my"
M8AA5_WOz4A,728.38,"weight onto it okay here's the common"
M8AA5_WOz4A,733.84,"mistakes people try and do that this way"
M8AA5_WOz4A,737.34,"right even if you have shoes on it's not"
M8AA5_WOz4A,740.89,"very effective you have to use the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,743.02,"outside because this is not designed to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,746.05,"step on right the outside is designed to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,748.6,"step on that's where it's solid and"
M8AA5_WOz4A,750.13,"strong so I want to be here and I step"
M8AA5_WOz4A,753.76,"all the way on to it okay"
M8AA5_WOz4A,760.04,"yeah so I you're thinking ahead right I"
M8AA5_WOz4A,762.959,"like this so here's the secret to this"
M8AA5_WOz4A,765.149,"one because if I go over here and try"
M8AA5_WOz4A,766.68,"and step here it doesn't work right so I"
M8AA5_WOz4A,770.879,"have to put my weight on to this over"
M8AA5_WOz4A,772.92,"here so that all those weights on here"
M8AA5_WOz4A,774.42,"then I could do it and it works so"
M8AA5_WOz4A,777.569,"that's kind of the next phase so right"
M8AA5_WOz4A,780.449,"now just do it isolation just like that"
M8AA5_WOz4A,791.149,"you think don't worry too much about"
M8AA5_WOz4A,793.47,"trying to get your entire foot on there"
M8AA5_WOz4A,795.269,"since you do have shoes let's place the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,797.339,"bottom edge of your shoe on there just"
M8AA5_WOz4A,804.209,"go slow keep on keep on keep going yeah"
M8AA5_WOz4A,813.079,"you can do it harder on me try it on me"
M8AA5_WOz4A,821.6,"yep a little bit Lord little boy needs a"
M8AA5_WOz4A,826.62,"great target but go a little lower and"
M8AA5_WOz4A,828.509,"put some more pressure in it"
M8AA5_WOz4A,830.899,"yes yeah that's great excellent"
M8AA5_WOz4A,836.54,"yes that's good we're gonna look at the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,842.399,"neck right now we're looking striking"
M8AA5_WOz4A,845.129,"through here and penetrating right"
M8AA5_WOz4A,847.019,"through the target using this bone nice"
M8AA5_WOz4A,850.199,"the sharp part of our bone as we step"
M8AA5_WOz4A,852.72,"through and this is the footwork alright"
M8AA5_WOz4A,856.74,"I could also step with this leg just"
M8AA5_WOz4A,859.079,"depends on kind of like my angle"
M8AA5_WOz4A,861.959,"scenario now we're gonna look at the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,864.809,"back side of the neck real quick I'm"
M8AA5_WOz4A,867.3,"just going to come in here and hit it"
M8AA5_WOz4A,869.279,"with the top knock them down okay nice"
M8AA5_WOz4A,872.579,"easy target just coming over here Wow"
M8AA5_WOz4A,877.069,"just big hammer first let it drop like a"
M8AA5_WOz4A,879.689,"guillotine top the neck okay real quick"
M8AA5_WOz4A,882.48,"only a couple turns each and we're going"
M8AA5_WOz4A,885.12,"to move"
M8AA5_WOz4A,887.09,"so we're just same thing we're just"
M8AA5_WOz4A,889.23,"using a sharp edge we're right on the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,892.14,"back of the neck yep we're on the spine"
M8AA5_WOz4A,897.62,"yeah yeah just like chopping wood okay"
M8AA5_WOz4A,901.46,"yep I'll be here like this and use your"
M8AA5_WOz4A,905.46,"body weight to you as opposed to try and"
M8AA5_WOz4A,906.75,"hit like this use your body weight we"
M8AA5_WOz4A,909.03,"haven't done the ears yet the ears are"
M8AA5_WOz4A,911.04,"really important so there's different"
M8AA5_WOz4A,915.42,"ways to attack the ears one is just"
M8AA5_WOz4A,918.06,"clapping one or two all right"
M8AA5_WOz4A,925.88,"does that make sense so since we're kind"
M8AA5_WOz4A,929.04,"of running short on time we're gonna"
M8AA5_WOz4A,930.18,"like I'm gonna teach you three things"
M8AA5_WOz4A,931.92,"one is this the other one is this the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,936.45,"other one is this the next one after"
M8AA5_WOz4A,939.36,"this is boom then you grab them and then"
M8AA5_WOz4A,941.79,"you turn them okay so try all three of"
M8AA5_WOz4A,945.78,"those with each other real quick so use"
M8AA5_WOz4A,948.81,"your whole body not just your hand but"
M8AA5_WOz4A,950.76,"move move with it"
M8AA5_WOz4A,953.379,"oh that's nice nice so this is actually"
M8AA5_WOz4A,956.679,"when you need my fingernails right"
M8AA5_WOz4A,958.209,"because what you're doing on your grab"
M8AA5_WOz4A,959.41,"is you're grabbing with the fingernails"
M8AA5_WOz4A,960.669,"like this looking your nails to hook in"
M8AA5_WOz4A,963.789,"so if you have long fingernails this is"
M8AA5_WOz4A,966.009,"perfect you're gonna go right through"
M8AA5_WOz4A,967.779,"their ear so you go like this and you"
M8AA5_WOz4A,971.049,"grab here right so is if it's also a"
M8AA5_WOz4A,974.049,"skin grab so you grab like this see how"
M8AA5_WOz4A,977.709,"that's grabbing here in here and"
M8AA5_WOz4A,980.139,"pinching I can control them with the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,982.989,"skin grab I'm doing the same things to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,985.239,"the ears right here and once I have them"
M8AA5_WOz4A,987.909,"here I can control them take them and"
M8AA5_WOz4A,993.539,"throw them into the wall okay"
M8AA5_WOz4A,998.579,"here's why the common mistakes don't"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1000.72,"work when I said stop if I'm back like"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1004.079,"this see how I have no power I also have"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1006.449,"no presence right but it's more"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1008.789,"important for the next phase right and"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1010.919,"so when I say stop here and if he"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1012.869,"doesn't stop"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1013.859,"I've already have like it's really easy"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1016.049,"to come in but if I'm here and he comes"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1019.229,"in right it keeps on coming and I wait"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1021.989,"now it looks like he's gonna overpower"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1025.199,"me right he's gonna take me over instead"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1028.949,"of me taking him over I said you got to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1031.35,"be in this like lunging ready-to-run"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1033.6,"position"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1034.589,"stop right Wow then you come in alright"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1037.86,"so the next phase to this is notice the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1040.649,"reaction what happens when I hit up hi"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1043.279,"hips come forward that's a nice"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1045.629,"opportunity to then to do our growing"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1047.579,"strike that we talked about right so you"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1050.34,"can throw that in now stop"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1054.33,"boom like one two boom right and then I"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1058.019,"can kick usually because I'm thrusting"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1061.409,"forward and I'm moving like this I can"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1063.269,"usually do this one where's the other"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1066.09,"one I needed to do the knee because I"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1068.039,"was doing the chin so I'm much closer so"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1073.98,"right so you can this one I find that"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1077.399,"you need with this momentum doing the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1079.98,"full kick usually works better now what"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1082.559,"we're gonna do is a little bit of a"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1083.779,"combination of things right so I'm gonna"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1087.99,"he's gonna approach and I'm going to say"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1089.639,"I'm gonna put my hands up so this is a"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1091.59,"good posture if somebody approaches me"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1095.58,"and I feel uncomfortable I just put my"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1098.159,"hands up it puts me in a much better"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1100.26,"ready position but it's not like I put"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1103.139,"them up my fists and say hey I want to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1104.97,"fight right"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1107.299,"instead I'm preparing myself for the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1110.309,"worst but I'm hoping for the best right"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1114.269,"so it's a little bit like a surrender"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1115.95,"like oh hey what's up right so I'm not"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1121.2,"initiating anything but I'm being"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1123.99,"prepared in case I need to defend myself"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1128.69,"okay so he's gonna approach and I would"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1132.63,"say hey what's up and he's gonna really"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1134.789,"quickly maybe just punch me in the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1136.529,"stomach right and it could be a knife"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1138.75,"right let's see you have a knife there's"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1141.809,"one over there so I'll have my hands up"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1144.48,"I'm not sure what's going on and he just"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1146.549,"thrusts in and tries to do that right so"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1153.6,"that's the scenario that we're gonna"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1154.83,"deal with real quick and we're gonna"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1156.539,"like so there's a little bit of the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1160.34,"coordination because we've done all the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1162.149,"isolations stuff we've done this this"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1164.49,"and that all these different types of"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1166.11,"attacks now we're gonna try and see how"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1167.85,"we can fit them together right and this"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1170.279,"is gonna be one type of scenario that we"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1172.38,"can look at then we'll look at some more"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1174.24,"common ones like wear scrubs and things"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1175.95,"like that so when he comes in here and"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1179.82,"he tries to attack I'm just gonna step"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1182.01,"in like this and see what happens when I"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1184.23,"hit down like this it brings this"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1186.299,"forward so now I'm going to do this"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1187.95,"attack Wow now the groin is exposed so"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1192.149,"I'm just going to come in here"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1194.16,"oh now this remember this position I can"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1197.1,"take down this way see how everything"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1199.92,"kind of coordinated reactions work if I"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1203.1,"hit low then I'm gonna get a high target"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1206.01,"if I hit high I'm gonna get a low target"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1207.66,"and then you just kind of bounce back"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1208.8,"and forth like that right so this is"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1211.89,"very common because most people have no"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1214.23,"idea how to defend themselves against"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1216.27,"knife thrusts and be effective at it"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1219.24,"because it's not gonna be one of these"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1220.95,"little things like this it's gonna be"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1224.3,"right and so when I attack like that"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1230.39,"this is the most common defense that"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1233.46,"people do instinctively they just try"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1236.04,"and grab the knife right and so then cut"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1240.45,"up so instead he's got his hands up boom"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1245.25,"right now I can't throw another punch or"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1247.95,"another jab or punch because they you"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1250.5,"just hit me down here and all my weights"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1252.33,"off right here that's coiled up so that"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1254.55,"goes right in there but you can kind of"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1261.6,"control chaos by doing this right I know"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1264.99,"that I play a hit in this position well"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1268.47,"I'm gonna get this reaction I know I'm"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1270.48,"gonna get that reaction I know I'm gonna"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1271.98,"get that reaction I know that I'm gonna"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1273.72,"get that reaction oh so then I got this"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1275.73,"one"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1275.94,"boom and I can finish that make sense"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1281.3,"what you're trying to do is you're"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1283.2,"trying to assess where is the next"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1285.39,"target right and most of the time if you"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1288.72,"understand when I hit low I'm gonna get"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1290.46,"a high target next it kind of after a"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1292.74,"while training it comes becomes"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1294.51,"instinctive but just kind of break this"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1297.24,"down for a second I'm hitting down here"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1299.31,"he's kind of stuck there for temporarily"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1301.59,"right ran it in to fight things move but"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1304.62,"right there I've stuck him on his heels"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1306.33,"for a second boom then I just wait I"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1309.63,"wait for the reactions boom I wait for"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1311.28,"the reaction and then I get it and then"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1312.66,"I make bone and then right there I can"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1315.45,"choose to do this if I felt like I"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1319.74,"needed to finish right but then you see"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1322.11,"how all of a sudden we need to know how"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1324.63,"to move from"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1325.53,"all these different angles in different"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1327.27,"directions because we're gonna in a"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1329.55,"fight you'd ever know what happens and"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1331.41,"you just need to identify oh that"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1332.88,"position I can attack here that weak"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1335.85,"point I see that right so just look for"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1338.43,"the targets that we taught you and they"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1340.47,"don't have to be this particular"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1341.7,"scenario we're gonna kind of mix it up"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1343.5,"here in a second but just try this one"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1345.69,"one last time and then we'll do a"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1347.46,"different scenario Justin can you lay"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1350.64,"down on the floor for me all right so"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1355.01,"what happens only a foot away if I drop"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1357.87,"this on his face right so do you guys"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1362.7,"weigh more than 50 pounds right so a lot"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1368.37,"of times we don't realize how much power"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1370.5,"we have like so I won't ask you how much"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1375.6,"you weigh but I weigh 195 pounds that's"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1378.75,"a lot more than that right so all I have"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1381.63,"to do is put 195 pounds in one little"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1384.72,"point right because the reason why"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1386.19,"that's so devastating is this dead"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1387.75,"weight and it's falling right so if he's"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1390.54,"on the ground and I just go like this"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1393.93,"and drop my knee right with all my body"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1398.7,"weight but this doesn't work right if I"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1400.68,"go right all I have to do is you know"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1405.53,"just drop my weight that's where the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1408.6,"power is and that's where this power"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1410.16,"comes from when he don't go and stand up"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1412.02,"and you have your knife right so here"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1415.68,"I'm just dropping 195 pounds right into"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1418.41,"this point right on the arm we're gonna"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1421.44,"grab your wrist we haven't taught you"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1423.15,"wrist escapes right we're gonna we're"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1427.59,"gonna let you figure it out okay so"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1430.47,"we're gonna come up and they everybody's"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1432.45,"gonna get a turn so we'll start with you"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1436.46,"he's gonna grow your rest"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1443.65,"okay no no don't do the same thing do"

M8AA5_WOz4A,1513.01,"we do it we just learned a very"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1516.02,"important lesson here"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1517.46,"I warned you guys there's a difference"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1520.25,"between self-defense in martial arts"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1522.2,"right I'll teach you some martial arts"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1524.09,"right now martial arts teaches you how"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1527.81,"grab tight teach it you know what how as"

M8AA5_WOz4A,1534.73,"let go I can control them all right this"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1539.3,"is martial arts right because I'm a cop"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1541.94,"all right I might need to put them down"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1543.53,"I need to control"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1548.8,"that's martial arts right well we're not"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1551.57,"teaching martial arts so everybody when"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1555.17,"somebody grabs them not everybody not"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1557.9,"you right"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1559.52,"they start going into martial art mode I"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1561.65,"want eggs did they think the fight is"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1563.81,"here oh I've got to fight this I got"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1566.51,"there he's attacking me here I got to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1568.07,"fight this right so that's less"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1572.0,"effective we can teach you cool ways to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1574.64,"get out of it right boom I can come in"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1576.65,"here and do that but that's martial arts"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1582.37,"right and the advantage to martial arts"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1584.6,"is that I don't have to injure him to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1587.42,"control him but if you're thinking about"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1590.18,"self-defense why didn't anybody do this"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1594.68,"right you came really close right so you"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1597.89,"don't have to do all of these fancy"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1599.51,"tricks right grab me one more time oh"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1604.78,"all right you guys I tell you that right"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1607.73,"here's an application grab here wow that"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1614.24,"makes sense"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1615.04,"why didn't you block this try and block"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1617.51,"it all right so what if he does block it"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1624.77,"I don't care"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1625.91,"boom okay walk that one then so you"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1632.39,"can't block all of the the attacks right"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1634.73,"so that's the real difference between"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1636.89,"martial arts and self-defense and he"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1639.26,"grabs what about this one why didn't you"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1643.07,"think that's the easiest one Yeah right"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1646.75,"so everything that I taught you applies"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1649.49,"to any so that's the difference between"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1651.17,"a self-defense in the beginning I taught"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1654.08,"oh here's all the techniques against a"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1656.06,"wrist grab here's all the techniques and"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1658.25,"gets a bear hug here's all the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1660.05,"techniques but the bottom line is nobody"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1662.66,"remembers that when it comes into a real"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1664.7,"fight but you can remember some basic"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1667.28,"principles right so a real self-defense"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1669.29,"has to be principle based not techniques"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1671.3,"based it has to be able to just teach"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1674.27,"you some basic principles that you can"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1676.46,"remember so what is one principle that"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1680.0,"you learn from tonight so far"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1687.059,"yeah put all your weight behind your"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1689.83,"attack"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1698.29,"attacking that's a technique so what's"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1700.99,"the principle buying it yeah but your"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1704.59,"way by yeah you know yeah so that's a"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1710.47,"good point when we do our strikes"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1714.36,"they're never like this right boom"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1717.46,"it's gonna be like this boom we're"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1719.5,"always gonna step through the target"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1721.06,"good anything else yeah so to be honest"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1731.02,"there's not that many principles because"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1732.55,"we tell you because I didn't want to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1733.63,"overwhelm you so we've almost hit almost"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1735.79,"all of them already but if you so if you"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1738.9,"say the same thing with a different kind"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1741.61,"of point of view that's okay hey that's"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1746.26,"a hard one to get through to people"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1747.64,"because we don't want to do that right"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1750.12,"if and so you got it you're like why"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1752.89,"would I ever want to take somebody's eye"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1754.81,"out"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1755.02,"and I told somebody like what if"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1757.27,"somebody just killed three of your"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1758.83,"friends and you're next and after you"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1761.47,"die your daughter's going next are you"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1764.11,"going to like hesitate to take his eye"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1766.36,"out at that point you're like no I think"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1768.55,"it's a good time to take the AI"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1769.75,"technique and use that I've been holding"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1772.27,"that that's my ace in my pocket I didn't"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1773.95,"want to use it but I guess I got to use"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1776.29,"it now right cool over here"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1788.34,"situational awareness yeah absolutely"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1791.13,"that's awesome"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1792.82,"good I think for me pushing through and"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1797.35,"going through your chart penetrating"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1799.0,"through the target awesome like the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1803.71,"physical level that you can stop it"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1805.54,"before it gets more violent mhm"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1807.7,"nice it's always easier to to tackle"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1810.73,"phase one than it is phase two once you"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1812.95,"get to phase three it's really difficult"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1814.36,"and you know base for it's over right so"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1818.95,"you either got it handle it phase one"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1820.81,"two or three and then each one gets much"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1823.15,"much more difficult to deal with is more"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1832.33,"important than like the speed or"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1834.07,"thinking so that's awesome"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1837.43,"this is something that martial artists"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1839.08,"do not understand right"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1841.09,"so I get a lot of slack from martial"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1844.12,"artists that say well you know like your"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1845.44,"techniques are way too slow people will"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1847.6,"be able to you know block those or stuff"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1850.6,"like that but the reality is it's like"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1853.18,"you don't need to go fast"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1854.59,"if you connect with one strike and you"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1857.35,"create an injury you see a reaction the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1860.05,"next injury is much much easier to do"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1862.3,"right Google you've been you know"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1866.68,"amazing very good"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1880.71,"yeah all right so that leads us to the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1884.46,"exhaustion phase so this was phase two"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1886.86,"let's talk a little bit about exhaustion"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1889.23,"phase phase three so in Phase three"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1892.169,"you need to understand that when you"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1894.35,"deal with any kind of a fight scenario"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1896.999,"you always have three options right"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1898.74,"fight flight or freeze when you're"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1901.71,"dealing with a self defense scenario"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1903.259,"somebody's attacking you you have three"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1906.84,"options you can either fight you can fly"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1910.74,"it and run away or you can freeze so"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1914.19,"which one is the correct answer"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1915.809,"any thoughts what's that right is there"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1921.48,"anyone that would not be the correct"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1923.009,"answer"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1924.2,"freeze I get a lot of that but it"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1927.029,"depends on what you understand freeze to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1929.7,"be a lot of times we freeze for a reason"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1934.11,"and if you look in nature and animals"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1936.419,"have different defense mechanisms some"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1938.759,"are designed to be really agile where"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1940.71,"they can run away right others are"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1943.08,"strong so they fight others like sloths"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1946.619,"their defenses do just stand still and"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1949.019,"be invisible or hey just freeze so if"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1953.46,"there's a mass shooter you want to go"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1954.96,"run and they can just shoot you while"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1957.84,"you're running away or do you want to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1959.519,"run at them and try and fight some guy"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1960.99,"with a rifle or do you want to go hide"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1963.96,"under in that closet and lock it and"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1967.08,"find a safe place right so you have to"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1970.71,"understand that freeze sometimes we're"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1972.899,"freezing we don't know what to do that's"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1974.279,"not good right so to break that you have"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1976.98,"to breathe right just deep inhale deep"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1981.869,"exhale and come into the present moment"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1984.84,"so fear that's dealing with fear I was"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1988.139,"taught this from my yoga instructor"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1989.639,"years ago she explained to me that fear"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1992.82,"is not a emotion of the present it's a"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1995.999,"motion of the past or the future"
M8AA5_WOz4A,1998.49,"but not the present so I'm like I don't"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2001.7,"understand that explain it to me as well"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2003.679,"okay let's talk about the past you've"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2007.82,"had things happen to you before and so"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2010.58,"when you see the scenario you were"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2011.899,"thinking about"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2013.36,"what those negative things that happen"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2015.07,"to you and you in the past and it makes"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2016.54,"you afraid right so you're dwelling on"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2018.7,"things that happen to you that you can"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2021.46,"relate to that are similar does that"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2025.24,"make sense so what about the future"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2027.67,"how does that make sense this is your"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2030.76,"creative imagination going crazy on you"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2032.92,"like oh you can just picture all these"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2035.86,"bad things that are gonna that are gonna"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2037.72,"take place so you're not either in the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2041.2,"present you're either in the future or"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2044.92,"in the past when you're thinking about"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2046.18,"fear right so to bring ourselves into"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2049.99,"the present we need to just simply"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2051.61,"breathe and think so that's all take a"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2054.1,"big deep inhale through our nose and as"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2057.94,"we do that we're gonna say to ourselves"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2059.68,"a little mantra here just like I'm here"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2063.18,"and then exhale through your nose or"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2065.77,"your mouth it's most important that you"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2067.84,"inhale through your nose you can exhale"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2070.39,"through your nose or your mouth as you"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2072.55,"exhale you say now right so here now and"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2077.11,"that will help kind of ground you into"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2079.75,"the present moment and help kind of take"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2082.99,"that fear away so that you can then move"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2085.18,"so that's how you deal with the freeze"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2087.13,"if you're freezing up and you don't know"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2088.3,"what to do breathe for a second and get"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2093.97,"into the present and then things will"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2096.07,"kind of clear and hopefully you'll be"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2097.63,"able to see targets right that you can"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2100.9,"attack and take advantage of the"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2103.63,"attacker"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2104.35,"he's got me so one of the strategies"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2120.99,"with freeze along with that is another"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2125.08,"strategy which is deception right all"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2128.29,"wars are based on deception right so I"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2131.74,"want to before I get exhausted if I'm"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2135.31,"fighting and things aren't going well"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2136.96,"and this guy's way overpowering me I"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2139.03,"just hold a little bit of reserve of"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2142.33,"energy"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2142.94,"right and then I surrender okay I give"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2147.26,"up"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2147.46,"right and at that point because let's"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2151.339,"say he's got me and he spins my"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2152.809,"restaurant it's really gonna be"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2154.28,"difficult for me to fight back when he's"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2157.039,"doing this but there's not much he can"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2159.589,"do here either right so once I like I"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2162.38,"give up and I'm like okay just please"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2164.809,"don't kill me you know like just I'll do"

M8AA5_WOz4A,2175.88,"got a nice stiff arm here you don't like"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2186.859,"he just gave me the stiff arm so now"
M8AA5_WOz4A,2189.619,"you're gonna do something different"

MbX3u37xVYc,2.2,"— Hi all, we're Sasha and Katya"
MbX3u37xVYc,4.56,"— And our Free Fem Krav Maga project!"
MbX3u37xVYc,7.22,"(Online women's self-defense course)"
MbX3u37xVYc,10.14,"— Today we gonna talk about quite common attack"
MbX3u37xVYc,14.16,"A frontal choke."
MbX3u37xVYc,16.725,"It's when an attacker grabs you with two hands"
MbX3u37xVYc,19.785,"For your neck"
MbX3u37xVYc,20.94,"It could be closer or farther, it's a strong attack"
MbX3u37xVYc,23.98,"He could push thumbs in your throat"
MbX3u37xVYc,26.94,"He may dominate you and prevent from breathing"
MbX3u37xVYc,29.64,"Threats differ a bit, but the solution is the same"
MbX3u37xVYc,34.9,"In case if attacker grabs you this way"
MbX3u37xVYc,38.34,"And we will show this solution pretty soon."
MbX3u37xVYc,43.76,"What are you thinking about? What are you looking at?! Where have you been?!"
MbX3u37xVYc,46.76,"Can you tell me or not? Where have you been? WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?!"
MbX3u37xVYc,51.64,"— We already learned how to hit groin with knee"
MbX3u37xVYc,54.585,"And we also know how to attack with hammer punches."
MbX3u37xVYc,57.62,"We will use these two types of attacks in a technique"
MbX3u37xVYc,60.64,"that allows you to release from the frontal choke."
MbX3u37xVYc,63.665,"— Actually if we break down the attack on fragments"
MbX3u37xVYc,66.76,"Then we will deal with two problems"
MbX3u37xVYc,68.92,"The first one is that"
MbX3u37xVYc,71.74,"you neck is getting broken. You can't breath, you can't speak"
MbX3u37xVYc,75.805,"And just in a couple of seconds"
MbX3u37xVYc,77.7,"You won't be able to live."
MbX3u37xVYc,79.16,"And the second problem is the guy that performs this choke."
MbX3u37xVYc,83.44,"You deal with this probs according to priorities."
MbX3u37xVYc,86.3,"What's the first thing we should gonna do?"
MbX3u37xVYc,89.16,"— To release the neck and start breathing."
MbX3u37xVYc,91.62,"— So when you got choked..."
MbX3u37xVYc,(Checkpoint 1: DISRUPTION),""
MbX3u37xVYc,97.84,"Natural reaction when you got choked is"
MbX3u37xVYc,100.46,"trying to get rid of attacker's hands with this type of motions"
MbX3u37xVYc,103.62,"in order to start breathing, but these motions are useless."
MbX3u37xVYc,106.92,"Here krav maga makes a small step away from one of its principles"
MbX3u37xVYc,110.98,"One of general principles is"
MbX3u37xVYc,113.52,"Keeping natural reactions"
MbX3u37xVYc,115.92,"So the technique transforms your natural reflexes,"
MbX3u37xVYc,119.04,"these useless motions, to the effective reaction."
MbX3u37xVYc,122.035,"In case you can't do a disruption, don't worry, it may happen."
MbX3u37xVYc,124.965,"The goal is not only to release you from attacker's hands"
MbX3u37xVYc,127.935,"but also to give you extra half a second"
MbX3u37xVYc,130.98,"by making the grip weaker and distracting the attacker"
MbX3u37xVYc,134.42,"to please people in comments"
MbX3u37xVYc,135.96,"who write that groin kick works bad in 90% of cases"
MbX3u37xVYc,140.22,"because men usually ready for it."
MbX3u37xVYc,142.18,"— How do we make the disruption?"
MbX3u37xVYc,144.12,"We should remember a motion from 80-s"
MbX3u37xVYc,147.78,"— One-two, hands wider"
MbX3u37xVYc,150.3,"Legs wider..."
MbX3u37xVYc,152.42,"— This is what we have to do."
MbX3u37xVYc,154.74,"We have to place elbows perpendicular to attacker's hands"
MbX3u37xVYc,158.46,"Here we should put fingers together"
MbX3u37xVYc,161.22,"— To make a CUP!"
MbX3u37xVYc,162.735,"— To make a cup XD So we out fingers together..."
MbX3u37xVYc,165.72,"And to push our elbows backward in horizontal plane"
MbX3u37xVYc,170.52,"Like this"
MbX3u37xVYc,171.64,"Like this"
MbX3u37xVYc,173.6,"We use power of chest muscles"
MbX3u37xVYc,176.74,"Muscles of both our chest and back work together so you should feel the power"
MbX3u37xVYc,180.7,"of this disruption."
MbX3u37xVYc,182.76,"— It's really important to get all fingers together because"
MbX3u37xVYc,186.72,"only in this case you get a guarantee of a nice"
MbX3u37xVYc,189.4,"pull that disrupts attacker's hands with combined power"
MbX3u37xVYc,193.42,"of all muscles."
MbX3u37xVYc,195.18,"If fingers are not together"
MbX3u37xVYc,197.38,"and thumb is separated from other fingers then"
MbX3u37xVYc,200.62,"your grip is screwed and your hands can't perform a disruption."
MbX3u37xVYc,203.765,"You pull, but your hands get disrupted, not his."
MbX3u37xVYc,207.415,"And the choker chokes."
MbX3u37xVYc,209.155,"— We should hold the attacker's thumbs"
MbX3u37xVYc,212.195,"Right here, like this"
MbX3u37xVYc,215.785,"Here they are, one and two."
MbX3u37xVYc,218.58,"We pull from this position, from this place outwards"
MbX3u37xVYc,221.94,"— We work with combined power of hands and the body muscles actually only against one thumb."
MbX3u37xVYc,227.1,"We make a leverage of some sort."
MbX3u37xVYc,229.265,"— Once more. Where should we grab?"
MbX3u37xVYc,233.4,"We hold his thumbs from above"
MbX3u37xVYc,236.4,"With both hands..."
MbX3u37xVYc,244.26,"— Did you see what happened?"
MbX3u37xVYc,246.86,"Actually I did choked her"
MbX3u37xVYc,250.3,"Disruption failed at some point."
MbX3u37xVYc,253.38,"But at this very moment I was focused on chocking."
MbX3u37xVYc,256.76,"— And here we come to the next checkpoint of our technique."
MbX3u37xVYc,260.44,"— We kick balls with knee after all."
MbX3u37xVYc,263.08,"— Why do we really need it? We use it to switch attacker's attention."
MbX3u37xVYc,266.94,"Generally in krav maga many techniques use this principle"
MbX3u37xVYc,270.12,"and are built on switching levels of attacks."
MbX3u37xVYc,272.68,"Up-down, up-dow, up-down."
MbX3u37xVYc,274.9,"— When you're focused on doing something it's hard to switch to another thing on different level."
MbX3u37xVYc,281.14,"Especially if you got kicked in the groin that every man is proud of"
MbX3u37xVYc,284.36,"And when it hurts"
MbX3u37xVYc,286.58,"It's really complicated thing to understand what's happening around"
MbX3u37xVYc,289.68,"— Simultaneously with disruption..."
MbX3u37xVYc,(Checkpoint 2: KNEE STRIKE TO GROIN),""
MbX3u37xVYc,291.52,"We kick balls."
MbX3u37xVYc,(Checkpoint 2: KNEE STRIKE TO GROIN),""
MbX3u37xVYc,294.9,"— Getting a knee kick to the groin"
MbX3u37xVYc,297.58,"The attacker may collapse"
MbX3u37xVYc,299.64,"and at the same time hit a defending woman"
MbX3u37xVYc,301.98,"with his forehead to her face"
MbX3u37xVYc,303.72,"So while disrupting we should put our chin on the chest"
MbX3u37xVYc,307.8,"or incline our head forward and put our forehead on the line."
MbX3u37xVYc,311.92,"Thus the attacker won't crash our face with forehead,"
MbX3u37xVYc,315.12,"but will crash his face himself"
MbX3u37xVYc,318.32,"— With our forehead."
MbX3u37xVYc,321.54,"— Blah..."
MbX3u37xVYc,323.255,"— Well, we made the disruption"
MbX3u37xVYc,326.34,"and that enraged him..."
MbX3u37xVYc,327.78,"— We disrupted his plans!"
MbX3u37xVYc,329.74,"— We disrupted his plans and ruined his groin with knee or hit neighbouring area"
MbX3u37xVYc,334.82,"— Poor cutie pie!.."
MbX3u37xVYc,336.76,"— And we enraged him even more, but possbily we didn't make a single hit to him."
MbX3u37xVYc,341.28,"— Actually we made one hit."
MbX3u37xVYc,343.855,"But one hit is never enough."
MbX3u37xVYc,346.36,"— We didn't do anything frightening with him yet..."
MbX3u37xVYc,349.08,"— Yes, we didn't make him a service."
MbX3u37xVYc,352.08,"— This is a very exact moment when he's really mad"
MbX3u37xVYc,354.745,"and may crash us with his fury and several mighty blows."
MbX3u37xVYc,358.28,"It's not pleasant to imagine what he may do."
MbX3u37xVYc,361.135,"— That's why we need several good hammers."
MbX3u37xVYc,364.645,"— To the point!"
MbX3u37xVYc,366.225,"We perform regular hammer punches"
MbX3u37xVYc,369.18,"To any vital place we are able to reach like face"
MbX3u37xVYc,371.7,"back of his head, his neck."
MbX3u37xVYc,373.84,"We crash all vital points that will be exposed with all power we've got."
MbX3u37xVYc,377.86,"Come on, baby XD"
MbX3u37xVYc,379.46,"(Checkpoint 3: HAMMER PUNCHES)"
MbX3u37xVYc,383.18,"— After getting several hammer punches a person may behave"
MbX3u37xVYc,386.54,"somehow like this"
MbX3u37xVYc,388.3,"He may lose his balance after hammer punches, but"
MbX3u37xVYc,391.2,"We'll have to help him with this anyway."
MbX3u37xVYc,394.34,"After hammers you should push him"
MbX3u37xVYc,396.76,"and run away. Running away is the key point"
MbX3u37xVYc,399.54,"of krav maga techniques."
MbX3u37xVYc,401.46,"(Checkpoint 4: RUNNING AWAY)"
MbX3u37xVYc,405.64,"Pay attention that I know what might happen and I'm ready"
MbX3u37xVYc,408.0,"But when one's getting pushed in the face"
MbX3u37xVYc,410.86,"it's hard to resist it."
MbX3u37xVYc,413.06,"When you get pushed in the face you feel fingers in your eyes"
MbX3u37xVYc,416.26,"You feel a disturbing leverage on your neck"
MbX3u37xVYc,419.62,"It's nearly impossible to resist"
MbX3u37xVYc,421.96,"Going backwards."

nDLfbHPEAGo,273.759,"down to the stock market mcdonald's is a"
nDLfbHPEAGo,276.56,"publicly traded company which means that"
nDLfbHPEAGo,278.24,"the original owners of mcdonald's don't"
nDLfbHPEAGo,280.08,"own the whole company anymore far from"
nDLfbHPEAGo,282.08,"it instead the company is owned by"

nDLfbHPEAGo,285.919,"investors each with their own chunk of"
nDLfbHPEAGo,287.759,"the company some big some small and the"

nDLfbHPEAGo,295.12,"follow me on this mcdonald's is huge"

nDLfbHPEAGo,298.56,"chains in the world so as you can"
nDLfbHPEAGo,299.919,"probably imagine doing business with"

nDLfbHPEAGo,315.68,"closely tied to their relationship with"
nDLfbHPEAGo,317.28,"the golden arches when mcdonald's"
nDLfbHPEAGo,318.96,"expands taylor sells more equipment when"
nDLfbHPEAGo,321.039,"they close restaurants or people buy"
nDLfbHPEAGo,322.8,"less mcdonald's taylor feels that pain"
nDLfbHPEAGo,324.72,"too we can actually see this in the"
nDLfbHPEAGo,326.16,"stock prices for both these companies"
nDLfbHPEAGo,327.84,"taylor's parent company is middle b"
nDLfbHPEAGo,329.84,"corporation so that's whose stock price"
nDLfbHPEAGo,331.84,"we're gonna be looking at here and as"
nDLfbHPEAGo,333.199,"you can see in 2020 when restaurants"
nDLfbHPEAGo,335.039,"like mcdonald's were hard hit by the"
nDLfbHPEAGo,336.56,"pandemic at the end of february because"
nDLfbHPEAGo,338.32,"everyone was eating at home no one was"
nDLfbHPEAGo,340.08,"going out and no one was opening new"
nDLfbHPEAGo,341.6,"restaurants with new equipment middle"
nDLfbHPEAGo,343.199,"b's value tumble 2. when mcdonald's lost"
nDLfbHPEAGo,345.84,"about 30 percent of its value in a few"
nDLfbHPEAGo,347.6,"days middle b was right behind the"
nDLfbHPEAGo,349.759,"following week losing 50 percent"
nDLfbHPEAGo,352.479,"basically what you're seeing here is"
nDLfbHPEAGo,353.759,"evidence that the shareholders wait to"
nDLfbHPEAGo,355.199,"see what happens to mcdonald's and then"
nDLfbHPEAGo,356.88,"that directly affects the stock prices"
nDLfbHPEAGo,359.039,"of middle b but again how does this"
nDLfbHPEAGo,360.8,"relate to mcdonald's keeping broken ice"
nDLfbHPEAGo,362.72,"cream machines well there's one other"
nDLfbHPEAGo,364.72,"entanglement here that we haven't talked"
nDLfbHPEAGo,366.24,"about which is that mcdonald's and"
nDLfbHPEAGo,367.68,"middle b also share a number of key"
nDLfbHPEAGo,370.0,"shareholder banks the same big investors"
nDLfbHPEAGo,372.72,"own a piece of both companies meaning"
nDLfbHPEAGo,375.039,"that their biggest investors want to see"
nDLfbHPEAGo,376.8,"both of these companies winning and the"
nDLfbHPEAGo,378.319,"easiest way to do that is for them to"
nDLfbHPEAGo,380.56,"continue working together comparing the"
nDLfbHPEAGo,382.479,"top investors in each corporation you"
nDLfbHPEAGo,384.24,"can see that the top by far for both is"
nDLfbHPEAGo,386.56,"the vanguard group which is a massive"
nDLfbHPEAGo,388.56,"investment company who owns tons and"
nDLfbHPEAGo,390.16,"tons of pieces of companies across every"
nDLfbHPEAGo,392.16,"sector all over the world vanguard is a"
nDLfbHPEAGo,394.72,"big owner in both of these companies"
nDLfbHPEAGo,396.319,"owning eight point three percent of"
nDLfbHPEAGo,398.0,"mcdonald's and over nine percent of"
nDLfbHPEAGo,400.319,"middle b which translates to billions of"
nDLfbHPEAGo,402.72,"dollars that are on the line for their"
nDLfbHPEAGo,404.319,"investors in just these two companies"
nDLfbHPEAGo,406.319,"alone but it's not just vanguard"
nDLfbHPEAGo,408.08,"blackrock group comes in as the number"
nDLfbHPEAGo,409.84,"three shareholder for both companies"
nDLfbHPEAGo,411.44,"wellington management is number four for"
nDLfbHPEAGo,413.28,"mcdonald's and number two for middle b"
nDLfbHPEAGo,414.96,"and ssga is number two and number ten my"
nDLfbHPEAGo,417.599,"point here is that while mcdonald's and"
nDLfbHPEAGo,419.36,"middle b aren't the same companies they"
nDLfbHPEAGo,421.199,"are effectively owned by a lot of the"
nDLfbHPEAGo,422.8,"same people the same banks and"
nDLfbHPEAGo,424.639,"investment companies meaning that while"
nDLfbHPEAGo,426.479,"they are legally separate they're aiming"
nDLfbHPEAGo,428.4,"to please the exact same group people"
nDLfbHPEAGo,431.12,"that know that taylor is riding on the"
nDLfbHPEAGo,433.12,"coattails of mcdonald's people who win"
nDLfbHPEAGo,435.599,"when broken ice cream machines translate"
nDLfbHPEAGo,437.68,"to massive repair bills which translate"
nDLfbHPEAGo,440.0,"to billions of dollars in the stock"
nDLfbHPEAGo,442.319,"market so the next time you roll up to"
nDLfbHPEAGo,444.0,"the drive through at the local golden"
nDLfbHPEAGo,445.52,"arches for some soft serve and get"
nDLfbHPEAGo,447.12,"turned away just know that you're"
nDLfbHPEAGo,448.72,"helping to line some fat cat wall street"
nDLfbHPEAGo,451.12,"investor pockets but there is one way"
nDLfbHPEAGo,453.759,"that all of this might end up benefiting"
nDLfbHPEAGo,456.0,"you and that's because this whole broken"
nDLfbHPEAGo,457.919,"ice cream thing is tied up in the hot"
nDLfbHPEAGo,459.759,"button debate around right to repair for"
nDLfbHPEAGo,462.08,"those of you who don't know right to"
nDLfbHPEAGo,463.199,"repair has become something of a hot"
nDLfbHPEAGo,464.639,"button issue in recent years it"
nDLfbHPEAGo,466.16,"originated with automobiles so you could"
nDLfbHPEAGo,468.319,"take your broken car to any repair shop"
nDLfbHPEAGo,470.72,"before legislation you would only be"
nDLfbHPEAGo,472.24,"able to go to the original manufacturer"
nDLfbHPEAGo,474.08,"which meant that they could charge you"
nDLfbHPEAGo,475.36,"whatever they wanted because you weren't"
nDLfbHPEAGo,476.96,"able to go anywhere else at least not"
nDLfbHPEAGo,479.12,"without voiding your warranty that's"
nDLfbHPEAGo,480.879,"what's called a monopoly so this is"
nDLfbHPEAGo,482.96,"where the original right to repair"
nDLfbHPEAGo,484.4,"legislation came from because why"
nDLfbHPEAGo,486.24,"shouldn't you the owner of the car be"
nDLfbHPEAGo,488.319,"allowed to repair it however you choose"
nDLfbHPEAGo,490.4,"it's not rocket science but historically"
nDLfbHPEAGo,492.56,"companies have been extremely protective"
nDLfbHPEAGo,494.4,"about who can service their machines"
nDLfbHPEAGo,495.84,"because as we just saw with taylor they"
nDLfbHPEAGo,497.919,"stand to make a lot of money when they"
nDLfbHPEAGo,499.68,"have a monopoly over the ability to"
nDLfbHPEAGo,501.44,"service their product in recent years"
nDLfbHPEAGo,503.28,"we've seen right to repair pop up again"
nDLfbHPEAGo,505.199,"as an issue in the electronics industry"
nDLfbHPEAGo,507.28,"covering everything from home"
nDLfbHPEAGo,508.72,"electronics like your washer dryer and"
nDLfbHPEAGo,510.56,"oven to personal devices like your phone"
nDLfbHPEAGo,512.479,"and computer apple who up until recently"
nDLfbHPEAGo,514.8,"refused to let third-party repair shops"
nDLfbHPEAGo,516.64,"have access to parts or manuals to"
nDLfbHPEAGo,518.479,"repair your phone used to charge a ton"
nDLfbHPEAGo,520.719,"to fix it at the apple store the only"
nDLfbHPEAGo,522.8,"reason the tide has begun to change in"
nDLfbHPEAGo,524.48,"this is because late last year president"
nDLfbHPEAGo,526.32,"biden signed an executive order"
nDLfbHPEAGo,527.839,"directing the ftc to draft new"
nDLfbHPEAGo,529.6,"regulations limiting all this and"
nDLfbHPEAGo,531.68,"wouldn't you know it the ftc has chosen"
nDLfbHPEAGo,533.6,"to use an example company in their"
nDLfbHPEAGo,535.279,"investigation for right to repair our"
nDLfbHPEAGo,537.36,"very own mcdonald's and their ice cream"
nDLfbHPEAGo,539.6,"machines you see a few years ago jeremy"
nDLfbHPEAGo,542.0,"o'sullivan and melissa nelson wanted to"
nDLfbHPEAGo,543.839,"create a delicious deceptively bad for"
nDLfbHPEAGo,545.839,"you frozen yogurt dessert and they found"
nDLfbHPEAGo,547.68,"that the heating and cooling process of"
nDLfbHPEAGo,549.12,"the taylor c602 was perfect for"
nDLfbHPEAGo,551.44,"pasteurizing their product when you're"
nDLfbHPEAGo,553.12,"pasteurizing the national sanitation"
nDLfbHPEAGo,554.88,"foundation requires that the temperature"
nDLfbHPEAGo,556.64,"of the yogurt be tracked but o'sullivan"
nDLfbHPEAGo,559.04,"and nelson couldn't do that on the c602"
nDLfbHPEAGo,561.519,"because they couldn't access any of the"
nDLfbHPEAGo,562.959,"controls they couldn't access the"
nDLfbHPEAGo,564.32,"settings or the error codes without a"
nDLfbHPEAGo,566.24,"licensed technician from taylor one day"
nDLfbHPEAGo,568.48,"after actually calling a taylor"
nDLfbHPEAGo,570.0,"technician they noticed that the tech"
nDLfbHPEAGo,571.36,"was able to access a ton of information"
nDLfbHPEAGo,573.279,"out of the machine after entering a"
nDLfbHPEAGo,575.12,"secret four digit code into the control"
nDLfbHPEAGo,577.6,"panel a literal secret code that they"
nDLfbHPEAGo,579.92,"had to enter into the ice cream machine"
nDLfbHPEAGo,582.48,"what da vinci code reality are we living"

otT9RjLwWKc,103.55,"continued and punching she would"
otT9RjLwWKc,105.56,"obstruct it like I only stopped it"
otT9RjLwWKc,107.539,"because I thought like she could have"
otT9RjLwWKc,108.649,"continued non-stop for like two minutes"
otT9RjLwWKc,111.319,"you know you feel the shots yes okay and"
otT9RjLwWKc,113.84,"I knew obviously I didn't tell the SIL"
otT9RjLwWKc,116.54,"but she did a seminar I knew that she"

otT9RjLwWKc,124.13,"like go crazy on it and I knew that's"
otT9RjLwWKc,125.93,"the difference between a survival"
otT9RjLwWKc,129.61,"mindset II fighting mindset you know"
otT9RjLwWKc,132.62,"there's no way she wouldn't put up a"
otT9RjLwWKc,134.299,"fight any way she could she would have"
otT9RjLwWKc,136.22,"put up a fight to the last second and"
otT9RjLwWKc,137.989,"knowing what you did she reacted"
otT9RjLwWKc,139.519,"completely differently than the rest of"
otT9RjLwWKc,140.989,"the women just by bucking and"
otT9RjLwWKc,142.31,"understanding to strike as fast as"
otT9RjLwWKc,144.62,"possible how did you feel with that it's"
otT9RjLwWKc,147.14,"been a long time you didn't do that"
otT9RjLwWKc,148.01,"right right five years so you know you"
otT9RjLwWKc,150.829,"had a small seminar sometimes a little"
otT9RjLwWKc,153.049,"tricks that you learn will stain your"
otT9RjLwWKc,154.4,"blueprint in your brain you'll remember"
otT9RjLwWKc,156.38,"them and know how to"
otT9RjLwWKc,157.39,"so it's a big difference between"

otT9RjLwWKc,160.93,"seminar even picking up some of some"
otT9RjLwWKc,162.94,"small stuff here versus knowing"
otT9RjLwWKc,164.44,"absolutely nothing how to how to react"
otT9RjLwWKc,166.99,"so how do you feeling yourself a little"
otT9RjLwWKc,173.41,"bit acid is good"
otT9RjLwWKc,175.75,"why didn't you palm strike there's just"
otT9RjLwWKc,178.57,"a reflex just reflex hey just think your"
otT9RjLwWKc,181.15,"instinct was just a punch that's fine"
otT9RjLwWKc,182.59,"like like you know I always teach palm"
otT9RjLwWKc,184.84,"strike I remember you were like me with"
otT9RjLwWKc,186.88,"Hermia and on the fray like this but"
otT9RjLwWKc,188.5,"right now is just like now the instinct"
otT9RjLwWKc,190.24,"you found that there and you just felt"
otT9RjLwWKc,191.41,"comfortable - hammering you know there's"
otT9RjLwWKc,192.94,"no right or wrong yeah she's done"
otT9RjLwWKc,195.79,"seminars and you know I just wanna say"
otT9RjLwWKc,197.53,"palm strike but I didn't think that that"
otT9RjLwWKc,199.239,"moment was to just hammer hammer in the"
otT9RjLwWKc,201.73,"ribs and that's what it was or anything"
otT9RjLwWKc,203.5,"was to do is it wrong no the point is"
otT9RjLwWKc,206.56,"she got the job done she could be"
otT9RjLwWKc,207.79,"striking I'm sure how to continue to"
otT9RjLwWKc,209.47,"grab them sure she would have palm Dan"
otT9RjLwWKc,210.85,"elbowed and hammer fist cuz I'm sure you"
otT9RjLwWKc,213.01,"would have done that but at that point"
otT9RjLwWKc,214.36,"that's what came in and that's also to"
otT9RjLwWKc,216.25,"teach that there's no right or wrong in"
otT9RjLwWKc,218.41,"self-defense there's no like you know"
otT9RjLwWKc,220.209,"never punch never hit open hand at the"
otT9RjLwWKc,222.519,"end you do what you got to do to survive"
otT9RjLwWKc,224.59,"and that's what she did and one thing if"
otT9RjLwWKc,226.6,"you notice comparing to all the rest of"
otT9RjLwWKc,229.06,"the women they all kept the woman all"
otT9RjLwWKc,230.62,"the women kept their legs straight and"
otT9RjLwWKc,232.33,"turned around gave their back she knew"
otT9RjLwWKc,234.459,"from one seminar the first thing she did"
otT9RjLwWKc,236.26,"she brought up her legs and the first"
otT9RjLwWKc,238.209,"thing she did she did boom you weren't"
otT9RjLwWKc,239.47,"expecting that you're right because all"
otT9RjLwWKc,241.269,"the other woman just kind of she knew as"
otT9RjLwWKc,242.68,"soon as I saw the video she blows placed"
otT9RjLwWKc,244.54,"her legs up so as I said the first thing"
otT9RjLwWKc,246.91,"she did she's bucked she robbed"
otT9RjLwWKc,248.38,"she's visually happen he just started"
otT9RjLwWKc,250.45,"hammering away you know I mean you know"
otT9RjLwWKc,252.67,"I want to say all don't punch out well"
otT9RjLwWKc,254.29,"that was effective at that point and you"
otT9RjLwWKc,256.09,"saw him right like he's a big guy but he"
otT9RjLwWKc,258.4,"just she just kept nailing in the ribs"
otT9RjLwWKc,260.739,"and I'm sure how do you continue she"
otT9RjLwWKc,262.57,"would have kept striking I knew I"
otT9RjLwWKc,264.52,"stopped it only because she would have"
otT9RjLwWKc,266.169,"not ended without you being like"

otT9RjLwWKc,294.08,"knife it still doesn't matter just to"

Ozb-hBVQK9c,1179.039,"but regardless it's still a solid"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1180.64,"connection we see another head-based"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1182.559,"gadget in the season 11 episode bottle"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1184.559,"burglars an invisible helmet being"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1186.559,"advertised in a magazine for only 99"

Ozb-hBVQK9c,1203.44,"that doesn't really line up with what we"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1205.039,"know about plankton as an inventor plus"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1206.799,"i can't see them selling a tiny version"

Ozb-hBVQK9c,1213.84,"people of bikini bottom possibly as a"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1215.84,"way to create more robots alright so"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1218.4,"we're starting to get a pretty clear"

Ozb-hBVQK9c,1221.919,"the citizens of bikini bottom into"

Ozb-hBVQK9c,1422.48,"the idea for a moment that patrick might"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1424.64,"be some sort of robot how would he have"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1426.4,"gotten converted and why does this cause"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1428.48,"him to randomly become smart every once"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1430.159,"in a while well i looked at all the"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1432.0,"scenes where patrick suddenly does"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1433.44,"something smart and i noticed a bit of a"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1436.0,"pattern there are two different types of"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1437.84,"these moments there are times when we"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1439.6,"think he's saying something intelligent"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1441.279,"wait spongebob we're not cavemen"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1445.12,"we have technology but then it's"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1447.52,"revealed he's not actually being smart"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1452.08,"this doesn't contradict his character at"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1453.679,"all patrick is someone who doesn't see"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1455.36,"himself as dumb so there's lots of times"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1457.039,"when he tries to be smart but he fails"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1459.279,"dumb people are always blissfully"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1461.44,"unaware of how dumb they really are"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1465.84,"but there are also moments where he"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1467.36,"actually does do something undeniably"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1469.52,"smart wait a minute squidward they might"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1472.32,"be on to something we could filter the"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1474.48,"co2 through our ballast tanks re-fire"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1477.279,"the engines and ride the shockwave out"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1479.919,"of here"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1481.12,"wow he's right but then he immediately"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1483.52,"acts oblivious to the fact that he was"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1484.96,"being smart we're going through with"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1486.559,"your plan patrick yay"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1488.64,"what plan"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1489.84,"so i kept track of these two different"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1491.52,"types of moments and it seems like after"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1493.679,"season three is when he suddenly"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1495.44,"switches from pretending to be smart to"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1497.44,"actually having these smart moments and"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1499.6,"this switch perfectly lines up with the"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1501.679,"season 4 episode patrick's smartypants"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1504.559,"in this episode patrick falls off a"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1506.24,"cliff and gets his head knocked off"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1507.6,"spongebob accidentally replaces his head"

Ozb-hBVQK9c,1513.36,"i find all this laughter to be highly"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1515.52,"illogical in the end they switch back to"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1517.679,"his normal head and patrick goes back to"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1519.279,"his usual stupid self but take a closer"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1521.6,"look at the scene when he first puts on"

Ozb-hBVQK9c,1525.52,"[Applause]"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1532.0,"now many people have interpreted these"

Ozb-hBVQK9c,1537.12,"now but these gears are not from"

Ozb-hBVQK9c,1545.76,"the end of the episode when they remove"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1547.12,"the brain coral we can still see the"

Ozb-hBVQK9c,1558.799,"the whirly brains a robotic device that"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1560.799,"plugs into your brain to control you"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1562.799,"isn't it convenient that patrick just"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1564.72,"happened to land next to a pile of coral"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1566.48,"that looked identical to his head is it"
Ozb-hBVQK9c,1568.559,"possible that plankton saw this as an"

Ozb-hBVQK9c,1574.64,"it he went back to normal right he"

PcEpaiL_ey8,774.24,"of sorts so this is this could quite"
PcEpaiL_ey8,776.399,"easily be"
PcEpaiL_ey8,777.6,"where monty destroyed bonnie i reckon"

PcEpaiL_ey8,782.88,"nothing much is back here they put down"

PcEpaiL_ey8,786.24,"is where the scene of the crime happened"
PcEpaiL_ey8,788.32,"or maybe it's just to stop paint being"
PcEpaiL_ey8,790.399,"spilled on the floor but i reckon this"

PcEpaiL_ey8,815.44,"jumped him while he was in the john that"

pndPbpHLpos,are on point they earn their pink belt.,""
pndPbpHLpos,75.63,"A special belt that we created to signify"
pndPbpHLpos,successful completion of this amazing program.,""
pndPbpHLpos,85.2,"The physical techniques are critical"
pndPbpHLpos,86.86,"but it's equally important to understand"
pndPbpHLpos,the psychology of an assault.,""
pndPbpHLpos,90.04,"One of the most important things we discuss"
pndPbpHLpos,is intention assessment.,""
pndPbpHLpos,93.72,"Let's say I'm alone at a gas station,"
pndPbpHLpos,and a man from a nearby bus stop,""
pndPbpHLpos,97.12,"gets up and starts walking directly towards me"
pndPbpHLpos,99.54,"and I assert myself, and I tell him to stop"
pndPbpHLpos,101.84,"and he continues to walk towards me"
pndPbpHLpos,103.72,"what do I know at that exact moment?"
pndPbpHLpos,105.86,"I know that he has bad intentions"
pndPbpHLpos,108.42,"and once I know his intentions"
pndPbpHLpos,I can start preparing for his actions,""
pndPbpHLpos,112.3,"but until I set a boundary"
pndPbpHLpos,113.54,"his intentions are unknown."
pndPbpHLpos,115.28,"Boundaries are everything."
pndPbpHLpos,116.78,"Women Empowered is so different because"
pndPbpHLpos,they teach us the scalability of jiu-jitsu,""
pndPbpHLpos,and the psychology of an attack.,""
pndPbpHLpos,123.86,"Whether it's somebody you know"
pndPbpHLpos,or somebody you don't know,""
pndPbpHLpos,127.16,"and so it's so applicable at work because I know these people have to be around these people"
pndPbpHLpos,132.26,"but I have the right to be confident and be comfortable no matter who I'm around."
pndPbpHLpos,137.28,"What makes jiu-jitsu perfect for women"
pndPbpHLpos,138.72,"is that it's the only martial art that effectively addresses"
pndPbpHLpos,what to do when the fight goes to the ground,""
pndPbpHLpos,143.5,"and if there's one thing we know"
pndPbpHLpos,for sure it's that the attacker will do everything in his power to get us there.,""
pndPbpHLpos,148.5,"My daughter and I signed up at the Gracie Academy"
pndPbpHLpos,150.96,"because she's gonna be going to college next year"
pndPbpHLpos,153.286,"and I felt much more comfortable with her having some self-defense training before being on a college campus."
pndPbpHLpos,157.98,"I feel much better about"
pndPbpHLpos,her going off to college next year,""
pndPbpHLpos,161.26,"and I feel safer myself too, on the street."
pndPbpHLpos,165.7,"At the end of the day, we know that victory"
pndPbpHLpos,is getting home safely.,""
pndPbpHLpos,168.5,"The Women Empowered program teaches how to neutralize an assault"
pndPbpHLpos,172.04,"escape if possible, and if escape is not possible"
pndPbpHLpos,174.94,"how to incapacitate the attacker"
pndPbpHLpos,with a joint lock or chokehold.,""
pndPbpHLpos,178.5,"I really feel like it changed my life"
pndPbpHLpos,because it brought me back to who I am.,""
pndPbpHLpos,183.4,"I lost myself for a long time."
pndPbpHLpos,Finding jiu-jitsu helped me find my strength again.,""
pndPbpHLpos,187.44,"Words can't even describe how much happier I am"
pndPbpHLpos,how much more confident I am.,""
pndPbpHLpos,191.26,"I really feel like it's changed my life a lot."
pndPbpHLpos,193.76,"One of the things I love about being here is how supportive all the other girls are"
pndPbpHLpos,196.68,"how much encouragement they give us"
pndPbpHLpos,199.34,"I feel like after the class"
pndPbpHLpos,like I could conquer the whole world.,""
pndPbpHLpos,201.94,"What separates Women Empowered"
pndPbpHLpos,from every other self-defense program out there,""
pndPbpHLpos,205.48,"is the Violence Scalability Factor"
pndPbpHLpos,207.48,"because not every situation warrants"
pndPbpHLpos,the same degree of violence in our response.,""
pndPbpHLpos,211.4,"This is critical because statistically, 78% of sexual assaults are committed by people that we know."
pndPbpHLpos,217.14,"For example, if you're at a work function"
pndPbpHLpos,and a drunk co-worker starts getting out of hand,""
pndPbpHLpos,221.4,"and getting a little too touchy-feely"
pndPbpHLpos,223.22,"you're probably not going to feel inclined to"
pndPbpHLpos,gouge his eyes out or palm strike them in the face,""
pndPbpHLpos,227.74,"but if that's the only self-defense you've learned, chances are you won't do anything at all."
pndPbpHLpos,232.22,"With Women Empowered we teach everything from simple de-escalation techniques"
pndPbpHLpos,235.8,"all the way to deadly force techniques"
pndPbpHLpos,for worst-case scenarios,""
pndPbpHLpos,239.06,"so no matter who the perpetrator is"
pndPbpHLpos,or what the circumstance, we have a plan.,""
pndPbpHLpos,243.52,"I for a long time had thought it would be a good idea for me to take women's self-defense"
pndPbpHLpos,247.84,"but I was always too intimidated to do so."
pndPbpHLpos,249.72,"I was really, really, really nervous because"
pndPbpHLpos,this was so outside the scope of my comfort level,""
pndPbpHLpos,254.72,"but the environment was so"
pndPbpHLpos,supportive of that,""
pndPbpHLpos,257.46,"it just kind of pulled me in and swept me up"
pndPbpHLpos,260.08,"and the next thing I know I'm at"
pndPbpHLpos,the end of Women Empowered and I thought,""
pndPbpHLpos,"I don't want this to end",""
pndPbpHLpos,264.28,"and it's such a secure place to be"
pndPbpHLpos,266.98,"and it's such a cooperative"
pndPbpHLpos,and collaborative learning environment.,""
pndPbpHLpos,271.18,"And for me, that is every reason"
pndPbpHLpos,why I'm here.,""
pndPbpHLpos,274.669,"Once a woman owns these techniques,"
pndPbpHLpos,and is prepared for worst-case scenarios,""
pndPbpHLpos,278.389,"she's so much more likely to"
pndPbpHLpos,preemptively assert herself,""
pndPbpHLpos,281.5,"which could really help"
pndPbpHLpos,deter an assault before it happens.,""
pndPbpHLpos,284.28,"I had an incident where I was in the car somebody was trying to break in my car and he hadn't seen me yet"
pndPbpHLpos,289.58,"so instead of like panicking and getting really scared"
pndPbpHLpos,291.5,"I just stopped, thought, and my mind went"
pndPbpHLpos,super clear, and I still saw that he didn't see me,""
pndPbpHLpos,295.84,"so I thought "what's the safest way"
pndPbpHLpos,for me to get out of this situation?",""
pndPbpHLpos,298.72,"I went and just hit the window and started screaming and scaring the crap out of him"
pndPbpHLpos,303.26,"and luckily it terrified him, and he ran off."
pndPbpHLpos,307.36,"I think the most important part is that I didn't feel unprepared, I did feel totally empowered."
pndPbpHLpos,311.94,"I think without my training I"
pndPbpHLpos,would have just freaked,""
pndPbpHLpos,314.52,"and not been able to handle the situation and even now"
pndPbpHLpos,when I look back on the situation,""
pndPbpHLpos,318.22,"I'm not scared by it, I feel empowered by it."
pndPbpHLpos,326.06,"We kind of defeat ourselves with the perception that it doesn't belong to us"
pndPbpHLpos,330.12,"or somehow we don't connect"
pndPbpHLpos,331.57,"and it's really because our own perception of what it is"
pndPbpHLpos,334.72,"and what we really need to do is get in there"
pndPbpHLpos,and learn what it's really about,""
pndPbpHLpos,and see how it really is for everybody.,""
pndPbpHLpos,343.16,"Ever since learning Women Empowered"
pndPbpHLpos,345.2,"I just never have that"
pndPbpHLpos,uncomfortable uncertainty anymore,""
pndPbpHLpos,349.322,"I just have this real confidence"
pndPbpHLpos,352.86,"and it's just so powerful to me"
pndPbpHLpos,355.7,"that I can, that I can just..."
pndPbpHLpos,365.2,"It's so funny that it still makes me cry,"
pndPbpHLpos,it just makes me so happy.,""
pndPbpHLpos,372.54,"As women we have the right to"
pndPbpHLpos,control our bodies and our boundaries.,""
pndPbpHLpos,377.04,"Women Empowered"
pndPbpHLpos,has given me the tools to do just that.,""
PNE3kC0-GH0,2.06,"okay coach Jones here role martial arts"
PNE3kC0-GH0,4.92,"and coach Danny hahahaha so the move"
PNE3kC0-GH0,8.04,"we're working on right now is is mount"
PNE3kC0-GH0,10.889,"escapes and in particular a bridge and"
PNE3kC0-GH0,12.87,"roll so this will be a long video but"
PNE3kC0-GH0,15.059,"it's the first one of the original rule"
PNE3kC0-GH0,16.68,"because it teaches a lot of the concept"
PNE3kC0-GH0,17.88,"we're gonna show a lot of the bridge in"
PNE3kC0-GH0,19.14,"role and mount so if I'm gonna crush"
PNE3kC0-GH0,21.93,"coach Danny so we're here mountains most"
PNE3kC0-GH0,26.16,"people are familiar with this position"
PNE3kC0-GH0,27.449,"if you've got older brothers and sisters"
PNE3kC0-GH0,29.22,"you've probably seen this before this is"
PNE3kC0-GH0,31.98,"probably one of the most common"
PNE3kC0-GH0,33.899,"positions that people know and it's it's"
PNE3kC0-GH0,37.2,"where you just sit on the person so a"
PNE3kC0-GH0,38.85,"couple things from here is we're gonna"
PNE3kC0-GH0,40.95,"learn about managing distance because"
PNE3kC0-GH0,42.18,"there's different distances that someone"
PNE3kC0-GH0,43.469,"can be at so I could be up high I could"
PNE3kC0-GH0,45.51,"be throwing punches from here I could be"
PNE3kC0-GH0,47.19,"trying to strangle somebody all kinds of"
PNE3kC0-GH0,49.59,"stuff the most common things that people"
PNE3kC0-GH0,51.809,"think they can do from here what are"
PNE3kC0-GH0,53.73,"some things that people think they can"
PNE3kC0-GH0,54.809,"do a lot of people think they can just"
PNE3kC0-GH0,56.28,"punch back and be sure that yes she's"
PNE3kC0-GH0,59.76,"got really long arms and if I go up I"
PNE3kC0-GH0,62.399,"gives me more distance to generate more"
PNE3kC0-GH0,64.26,"Donkey Kong power and she can't touch me"
PNE3kC0-GH0,68.15,"another thing if you are a female and a"
PNE3kC0-GH0,71.43,"lot of the girls think this is gonna be"
PNE3kC0-GH0,72.93,"the number one move they're gonna like"
PNE3kC0-GH0,74.4,"knock the person across the room"
PNE3kC0-GH0,75.72,"anything like this is they're throwing"
PNE3kC0-GH0,77.67,"elbows or something like that you know"
PNE3kC0-GH0,79.71,"where yeah some people say elbows to the"
PNE3kC0-GH0,82.32,"leg which isn't that bad something"
PNE3kC0-GH0,84.9,"people say hit the groin or do something"
PNE3kC0-GH0,86.549,"to the groin I always like to say that"
PNE3kC0-GH0,89.49,"if you were like especially for guys"
PNE3kC0-GH0,92.159,"like have you ever been hit there"
PNE3kC0-GH0,94.59,"are you just like oh okay kitchens or"
PNE3kC0-GH0,97.35,"you're like oh I feel like hitting"
PNE3kC0-GH0,99.0,"something"
PNE3kC0-GH0,99.54,"what can I hit oh I'm so mad so she's"
PNE3kC0-GH0,102.72,"not in a position where she wants to and"
PNE3kC0-GH0,104.13,"she wants to start a striking match cuz"
PNE3kC0-GH0,107.189,"like we mentioned she can't hit me from"
PNE3kC0-GH0,108.899,"here she's also doesn't have gravity on"
PNE3kC0-GH0,110.909,"her side or body mechanics if she has"
PNE3kC0-GH0,112.619,"her arm like she's trying to wind up the"
PNE3kC0-GH0,114.149,"grounds there so she can't hit harder"
PNE3kC0-GH0,115.619,"either it's just like spaghetti arms the"
PNE3kC0-GH0,118.079,"top person has gravity all kinds of"
PNE3kC0-GH0,119.61,"stuff they could do and people say like"
PNE3kC0-GH0,122.219,"I'll bite this and that if I wanted to I"
PNE3kC0-GH0,124.649,"could put my thumbs into her eye sockets"
PNE3kC0-GH0,126.84,"and just push to the ground just do the"
PNE3kC0-GH0,128.459,"rooms demonstrate that game of throw"
PNE3kC0-GH0,131.52,"the elbows to the legs that's a that's a"
PNE3kC0-GH0,133.96,"thing any of that stuff is just inviting"
PNE3kC0-GH0,136.99,"striking match and you're not in a"
PNE3kC0-GH0,139.0,"position where you're gonna do any any"
PNE3kC0-GH0,141.43,"good with that even when it comes to"
PNE3kC0-GH0,143.2,"knees a lot of people say I'll just need"
PNE3kC0-GH0,145.03,"them in the hips or something like that"
PNE3kC0-GH0,146.14,"but if you see where I'm actually"
PNE3kC0-GH0,147.31,"hitting I'm hating with the top of my"
PNE3kC0-GH0,149.23,"leg right now so it's not even my legs"
PNE3kC0-GH0,150.88,"or my knee yeah your thigh will kind of"
PNE3kC0-GH0,153.88,"like hit me in the back so some stuff"
PNE3kC0-GH0,159.34,"what are some stuff that we can do the"
PNE3kC0-GH0,160.99,"first thing that we're going to learn"
PNE3kC0-GH0,162.13,"there's a lot of things and it's all"
PNE3kC0-GH0,163.72,"about options and having a lot of"
PNE3kC0-GH0,165.16,"options to choose from because not"
PNE3kC0-GH0,166.66,"everything works all the time is the"
PNE3kC0-GH0,170.5,"first one that we're going to do is a"
PNE3kC0-GH0,171.34,"bridging role so anything else with this"
PNE3kC0-GH0,174.3,"okay so show the karate chop so we'll"
PNE3kC0-GH0,182.98,"set back up from from the bridge and"
PNE3kC0-GH0,186.459,"roll a couple things that we're doing"
PNE3kC0-GH0,188.31,"the first one that we we do she can grab"
PNE3kC0-GH0,191.35,"my arm any time like right now oh"
PNE3kC0-GH0,192.82,"there's my arm sometimes I like to show"
PNE3kC0-GH0,195.28,"like if somebody's sitting on top of you"
PNE3kC0-GH0,197.23,"just trying to strangle you it's the"
PNE3kC0-GH0,198.79,"same thing that you could do if if if I"
PNE3kC0-GH0,202.09,"like had her shirt or something or I was"
PNE3kC0-GH0,204.61,"grabbing her here or pushing on her arms"
PNE3kC0-GH0,206.23,"or I had my forearm in her face she can"
PNE3kC0-GH0,208.269,"still trap and it's the same thing so"
PNE3kC0-GH0,210.28,"it's the same trap and and then the big"
PNE3kC0-GH0,213.489,"motion that we're doing is that is the"
PNE3kC0-GH0,214.72,"bridge and roll so just to break it down"
PNE3kC0-GH0,216.76,"a little bit"
PNE3kC0-GH0,217.69,"can you walk through some things that"
PNE3kC0-GH0,218.95,"you're doing so one thing I want to do I"
PNE3kC0-GH0,220.299,"want to be able to trap the arm it is"
PNE3kC0-GH0,221.89,"ideal if I'm able to break down their"
PNE3kC0-GH0,223.54,"posture a little bit by pulling it on"
PNE3kC0-GH0,225.37,"the elbow major thing is the trapping"
PNE3kC0-GH0,228.01,"the floor over here and then the"
PNE3kC0-GH0,229.18,"bridging that's the main thing so I want"
PNE3kC0-GH0,231.37,"to be bringing my hips up to the sky"
PNE3kC0-GH0,232.72,"notice I'm not going up just on my neck"
PNE3kC0-GH0,235.03,"right here I want to actually go up on"
PNE3kC0-GH0,237.04,"my shoulder instead this way now you'll"
PNE3kC0-GH0,239.14,"notice a coach cho's is able to post it"
PNE3kC0-GH0,241.42,"with his hand if I just keep going at"
PNE3kC0-GH0,243.25,"this angle I'm actually still able to"
PNE3kC0-GH0,245.2,"knock them over so mukil my tippy-toes"
PNE3kC0-GH0,246.549,"wrenching right over getting to my knees"
PNE3kC0-GH0,249.579,"just like you're a cat you always want"
PNE3kC0-GH0,251.35,"to get up to here if I see over here we"
PNE3kC0-GH0,253.36,"call this the floppy fish and"
PNE3kC0-GH0,255.88,"what do you think he's gonna do he's"
PNE3kC0-GH0,257.11,"gonna hop right back on top so I want to"
PNE3kC0-GH0,259.959,"get to your trap the foot trap your arm"
PNE3kC0-GH0,262.48,"and the bridge won't get to my knees and"
PNE3kC0-GH0,265.33,"then from here karate chop get out there"
PNE3kC0-GH0,267.52,"so if coach Danny gets mad on me I'll go"
PNE3kC0-GH0,270.16,"through some of the other most common"
PNE3kC0-GH0,272.14,"mistakes when you're grabbing one detail"
PNE3kC0-GH0,275.32,"to have is when you grab is your elbow"
PNE3kC0-GH0,277.48,"down the reason why is because if my"
PNE3kC0-GH0,279.82,"elbow is where your knee is it makes it"
PNE3kC0-GH0,282.19,"so that she can't get her leg up and"
PNE3kC0-GH0,283.42,"it's gonna give me space so that I can"
PNE3kC0-GH0,285.13,"trap"
PNE3kC0-GH0,285.61,"if save her her knee goes rein way into"
PNE3kC0-GH0,288.34,"my armpit"
PNE3kC0-GH0,289.09,"I can't trap her leg now so that's one"
PNE3kC0-GH0,291.13,"small detail grabbing the wrist hand"
PNE3kC0-GH0,294.94,"behind the back also that way if she's"
PNE3kC0-GH0,297.64,"trying to pull her arm backwards it's"
PNE3kC0-GH0,299.11,"gonna be challenging I just need to keep"
PNE3kC0-GH0,300.58,"her arm I got my elbow one low what I"
PNE3kC0-GH0,303.34,"block the foot if you're gonna point"
PNE3kC0-GH0,306.46,"your knee anyway you want to point it"
PNE3kC0-GH0,308.44,"out word if you have your knee pointed"
PNE3kC0-GH0,310.33,"in sometimes people do that it's gonna"
PNE3kC0-GH0,312.07,"mess you up for your bridge or wall the"
PNE3kC0-GH0,313.87,"other detail is my foot on the other"
PNE3kC0-GH0,315.79,"side I want to have in between her feet"
PNE3kC0-GH0,318.4,"and close to my tailbone so that when I"
PNE3kC0-GH0,319.81,"bridge I can get up if my foot is on the"
PNE3kC0-GH0,322.36,"outside this is more if people know what"
PNE3kC0-GH0,324.85,"they're doing she can kick a grapevine"
PNE3kC0-GH0,326.17,"with with this side and if I'm trying to"
PNE3kC0-GH0,328.33,"bridge it takes away my bridge so I want"
PNE3kC0-GH0,330.82,"to keep my foot tight I'm gonna bridge"
PNE3kC0-GH0,332.65,"get my big head out of the way go up"
PNE3kC0-GH0,334.54,"over my shoulder and it's already over"
PNE3kC0-GH0,337.77,"another detail is the biggest mistake"
PNE3kC0-GH0,342.03,"common mistake that people do is they"
PNE3kC0-GH0,345.97,"roll they log roll so if coach Damien"
PNE3kC0-GH0,348.28,"shows a run long roll like the most"
PNE3kC0-GH0,349.9,"common thing that people do just kind of"
PNE3kC0-GH0,351.91,"log roll and that's how they get up"
PNE3kC0-GH0,355.8,"another one is they will bridge up and"
PNE3kC0-GH0,358.87,"over and then follow to their side so"
PNE3kC0-GH0,361.33,"this is kind of fall and then get to"
PNE3kC0-GH0,363.34,"their knees you want to go right from"
PNE3kC0-GH0,365.17,"your hips to the sky to your knees so I"
PNE3kC0-GH0,368.47,"want to go right from my hips to the sky"
PNE3kC0-GH0,370.41,"to my knees and then up so that I can"
PNE3kC0-GH0,374.11,"get out of that position"
PNE3kC0-GH0,375.32,"get out of that position good just"
PNE3kC0-GH0,377.66,"showing that right there this is"
PNE3kC0-GH0,378.8,"something that you can shadowbox on your"
PNE3kC0-GH0,381.08,"living room floor you can do by yourself"
PNE3kC0-GH0,384.38,"just that bridge and and then getting up"
PNE3kC0-GH0,387.44,"to your feet correctly and then you can"
PNE3kC0-GH0,388.88,"add a partner in and just one thing with"
PNE3kC0-GH0,391.64,"partners is always when you're"
PNE3kC0-GH0,393.35,"practicing make sure that practice is"

QcpmyrkgiHU,160.079,"which can be from all angles and elbows"
QcpmyrkgiHU,164.04,"are also a great option because you"
QcpmyrkgiHU,166.319,"won't hurt your hands and they can"

QcpmyrkgiHU,171.299,"now it can be downloads up it can be"

QcpmyrkgiHU,180.12,"a lot of options there if you want to"
QcpmyrkgiHU,182.79,"strike don't do it with closed fists try"
QcpmyrkgiHU,186.09,"to use palm strikes because that way you"

QcpmyrkgiHU,201.299,"poke the eye or something again"
QcpmyrkgiHU,204.94,"we're gonna go for palm strikes and"
QcpmyrkgiHU,207.16,"elbows if you have the opportunity then"
QcpmyrkgiHU,210.04,"do like a kick to the groin or something"
QcpmyrkgiHU,213.34,"or more likely if the person said"
QcpmyrkgiHU,216.1,"enclose something like a knee strike as"
QcpmyrkgiHU,220.15,"soon as you hit the opponent you wanna"
QcpmyrkgiHU,222.76,"try and get a weight as soon as possible"
QcpmyrkgiHU,226.32,"all right now I'm a nice guy actually so"
QcpmyrkgiHU,230.5,"I laid out this thing but in reality"
QcpmyrkgiHU,233.65,"maybe concrete or something but it"
QcpmyrkgiHU,235.99,"doesn't matter a few scratches is better"
QcpmyrkgiHU,238.75,"than being scarred for life or even"
QcpmyrkgiHU,241.78,"killed so basically I'm in this position"
QcpmyrkgiHU,245.35,"and the first thing is she wants to"
QcpmyrkgiHU,247.57,"defend herself from strikes from here I"
QcpmyrkgiHU,250.75,"can do a lot of things and I can easily"
QcpmyrkgiHU,252.43,"do damage so she's gonna bring me in"
QcpmyrkgiHU,257.04,"like this and so now I can't do as much"
QcpmyrkgiHU,260.89,"damage and it's easier for her to defend"
QcpmyrkgiHU,263.29,"herself"
QcpmyrkgiHU,263.8,"next up she's gonna do a technique which"
QcpmyrkgiHU,266.86,"in jujitsu is referred to as bridging"
QcpmyrkgiHU,270.07,"and basically what that means is she's"
QcpmyrkgiHU,273.52,"gonna shoot her hip upwards to get me"
QcpmyrkgiHU,277.27,"out of position then next up she's gonna"
QcpmyrkgiHU,281.07,"simultaneously hook my arm and my foot"
QcpmyrkgiHU,287.19,"and then she's gonna have her foot on"
QcpmyrkgiHU,291.34,"the opposite side ready to push off and"
QcpmyrkgiHU,295.03,"she's gonna go with all of her power"
QcpmyrkgiHU,298.05,"right after that"
QcpmyrkgiHU,307.27,"[Music]"
QcpmyrkgiHU,309.66,"okay so now this technique is if it's"
QcpmyrkgiHU,313.03,"someone really heavy a lot of times as a"
QcpmyrkgiHU,315.82,"female you'll be attacked by someone"
QcpmyrkgiHU,317.59,"heavier than you and but this is only if"
QcpmyrkgiHU,320.47,"you are very flexible and you need to"
QcpmyrkgiHU,322.3,"react quickly because you must react"
QcpmyrkgiHU,324.67,"before the person is down here basically"
QcpmyrkgiHU,327.31,"you want to bring up your leg and then"
QcpmyrkgiHU,330.91,"you want to push down as hard as you can"
QcpmyrkgiHU,333.1,"and then you just want to focus on"
QcpmyrkgiHU,337.18,"getting away"
QcpmyrkgiHU,342.33,"okay so we've switched roles here and"
QcpmyrkgiHU,345.43,"that's because this technique requires a"
QcpmyrkgiHU,348.22,"lot of strength so it's very important"
QcpmyrkgiHU,350.74,"if you want to have an option in this"
QcpmyrkgiHU,352.9,"position to really focus on doing a lot"
QcpmyrkgiHU,356.11,"of high jumps and really try to bring"
QcpmyrkgiHU,358.72,"your knees up towards your chest when"
QcpmyrkgiHU,360.76,"jumping that's gonna help you with this"
QcpmyrkgiHU,363.28,"technique so basically my focus is gonna"
QcpmyrkgiHU,366.94,"be to bring my knee all the way up to my"
QcpmyrkgiHU,369.7,"chest doesn't have to be all the way in"
QcpmyrkgiHU,372.34,"actuality but that's gonna be my focus"
QcpmyrkgiHU,374.77,"and from there I'm gonna hook the arm"
QcpmyrkgiHU,377.83,"like I showed in the previous technique"
QcpmyrkgiHU,379.69,"and then I'm gonna roll around trying to"
QcpmyrkgiHU,383.08,"do a strike if possible and then just"
QcpmyrkgiHU,385.09,"try and get away so let's see how this"
QcpmyrkgiHU,388.33,"goes all right"
QcpmyrkgiHU,400.62,"now for some tactics first of all"
QcpmyrkgiHU,404.219,"situational awareness is key if you're"
QcpmyrkgiHU,407.289,"listening a lot to music when you're out"
QcpmyrkgiHU,409.12,"and about it's a good idea to turn it"
QcpmyrkgiHU,411.189,"down especially if you're walking in a"
QcpmyrkgiHU,413.439,"shady neighborhood or somewhere with not"
QcpmyrkgiHU,415.689,"a lot of lightning when you figure you"
QcpmyrkgiHU,419.05,"may become a target but just no matter"
QcpmyrkgiHU,421.779,"where you are it's good to pay attention"
QcpmyrkgiHU,423.789,"to all the details now if someone tries"
QcpmyrkgiHU,428.169,"to grab you as a female a lot of times"
QcpmyrkgiHU,430.419,"they'll try to bring you away from the"
QcpmyrkgiHU,433.389,"public especially if they want to harm"
QcpmyrkgiHU,435.37,"you or perhaps it's a rape scenario or"
QcpmyrkgiHU,438.46,"something so it's important to make a"
QcpmyrkgiHU,441.099,"lot of noise and it's been said many"
QcpmyrkgiHU,444.49,"times that you're not supposed to yell"
QcpmyrkgiHU,447.52,"out rape or something because that work"
QcpmyrkgiHU,449.889,"may actually scare some people from"
QcpmyrkgiHU,452.05,"interacting and trying to get involved"
QcpmyrkgiHU,455.009,"and it's been suggested to yell fire but"
QcpmyrkgiHU,459.009,"personally I don't think that's a good"
QcpmyrkgiHU,460.9,"idea"
QcpmyrkgiHU,461.349,"and that's like no data to confirm that"
QcpmyrkgiHU,463.99,"that's the safest option but I figure if"
QcpmyrkgiHU,468.159,"someone goes fine it's kind of like"
QcpmyrkgiHU,471.039,"that's gonna be some attention but"
QcpmyrkgiHU,473.649,"unless you see a fire you're not gonna"
QcpmyrkgiHU,475.87,"get involved what's important is to make"
QcpmyrkgiHU,478.719,"some noise at least to be screaming or"
QcpmyrkgiHU,481.479,"something if you're gonna yell out help"
QcpmyrkgiHU,484.18,"then it may get people involved but just"
QcpmyrkgiHU,486.61,"make sure to make a lot of noise and the"
QcpmyrkgiHU,492.789,"cell phone that I need to get rid of it"
QcpmyrkgiHU,495.81,"it's way too way too many messages and"
QcpmyrkgiHU,499.539,"stuff so if someone tries to grab you"
QcpmyrkgiHU,503.849,"what you want is to have the public's"
QcpmyrkgiHU,507.669,"attention and have someone get involved"
QcpmyrkgiHU,509.56,"and try to help you"
QcpmyrkgiHU,510.939,"so make a lot of noise and try to do"
QcpmyrkgiHU,512.949,"everything you can to win some more time"
QcpmyrkgiHU,515.26,"if I can demonstrate like you're walking"
QcpmyrkgiHU,519.159,"and suddenly someone grabs you now I'm"
QcpmyrkgiHU,524.169,"gonna try and bring her away"
QcpmyrkgiHU,526.6,"now if first of all she's caught by"
QcpmyrkgiHU,529.84,"surprise and I'm a lot stronger so it's"
QcpmyrkgiHU,532.33,"going to be easy for me to bring her way"
QcpmyrkgiHU,534.33,"but one thing she can do to win more"
QcpmyrkgiHU,537.07,"time is to drop her weight and to just"
QcpmyrkgiHU,540.01,"make yourself happy yes that makes it a"
QcpmyrkgiHU,544.09,"lot more difficult and imagine she's"
QcpmyrkgiHU,546.76,"screaming as well that means that's a"
QcpmyrkgiHU,549.31,"lot of attention thank you so so that's"
QcpmyrkgiHU,553.99,"a good idea"
QcpmyrkgiHU,555.19,"even though generally speaking for self"
QcpmyrkgiHU,557.67,"defense it's a bad option to be down on"
QcpmyrkgiHU,560.89,"the ground"
QcpmyrkgiHU,561.7,"but if going to the ground means that it"
QcpmyrkgiHU,565.45,"takes longer for the person to bring you"
QcpmyrkgiHU,569.14,"along then there's a good chance you"
QcpmyrkgiHU,571.54,"just escape to avoid being arrested a"
QcpmyrkgiHU,575.14,"rapist is more likely to leave the"
QcpmyrkgiHU,578.2,"victim alone to be able to continue his"
QcpmyrkgiHU,581.71,"ex some other time that's been shown"
QcpmyrkgiHU,585.16,"number is time statistically a lot of"
QcpmyrkgiHU,587.44,"greatest will actually escape the"
QcpmyrkgiHU,590.14,"situation if if people respond and if"
QcpmyrkgiHU,594.1,"that's a lot of noise so we had"
QcpmyrkgiHU,597.34,"situational awareness and try to make"
QcpmyrkgiHU,600.7,"some noise make yourself heavy or"
QcpmyrkgiHU,603.22,"whatever it means just be a difficult"
QcpmyrkgiHU,605.92,"victim and of course if you see someone"

QcpmyrkgiHU,616.66,"crowd and not be somewhere alone where"
QcpmyrkgiHU,619.09,"you make fallen prey like if it's a"

QIoyfw_WjGg,46.399,"campfire with his bantha he sees lights"
QIoyfw_WjGg,48.879,"overhead in the distance and we get the"
QIoyfw_WjGg,50.879,"mando theme playing for the first time"
QIoyfw_WjGg,53.6,"in the book of boba fett he travels over"
QIoyfw_WjGg,55.52,"to find fennec on his bantha and this is"
QIoyfw_WjGg,57.6,"a direct connection to the mandalorian"
QIoyfw_WjGg,59.52,"season 1 episode 5 where fenik dies and"
QIoyfw_WjGg,62.48,"gets saved by that mysterious man"
QIoyfw_WjGg,64.72,"walking now this man is boba fett boba"
QIoyfw_WjGg,68.08,"takes lifeless fennec to the outskirts"
QIoyfw_WjGg,70.0,"of moscespa to a mod shop where we have"
QIoyfw_WjGg,72.4,"essentially a place for upgrades he's"
QIoyfw_WjGg,74.64,"greeted by a few of the cyborgs outside"
QIoyfw_WjGg,77.36,"and it's very cyberpunk-esque we even"
QIoyfw_WjGg,79.36,"see vegeta with his scouter and the chop"
QIoyfw_WjGg,82.0,"engineer inside fixes someone up when"
QIoyfw_WjGg,84.56,"boba says hey she's about to die and"

QIoyfw_WjGg,95.759,"me fenik gets modded and when boba says"
QIoyfw_WjGg,98.56,"aren't you going to cover it up the"
QIoyfw_WjGg,100.24,"modder says no because it would cover"
QIoyfw_WjGg,102.079,"all that beautiful machinery so"
QIoyfw_WjGg,103.439,"obviously these modders are all about"
QIoyfw_WjGg,105.04,"showing off their new parts and instead"
QIoyfw_WjGg,107.36,"of concealing them like we know most"
QIoyfw_WjGg,109.119,"cybernetics to be in star wars like"
QIoyfw_WjGg,111.119,"luke's hand for example they really like"
QIoyfw_WjGg,113.119,"showing them off so this kind of"
QIoyfw_WjGg,114.479,"explains the power ranger crew that we"
QIoyfw_WjGg,116.56,"saw which i know they're not the power"
QIoyfw_WjGg,118.0,"rangers but we just joke about them it's"
QIoyfw_WjGg,119.68,"become like a running joke now at this"
QIoyfw_WjGg,121.2,"point but they essentially are like"
QIoyfw_WjGg,123.68,"these guys they're like on the outskirts"
QIoyfw_WjGg,125.28,"of tatooine"
QIoyfw_WjGg,126.479,"they're kind of nomads so to speak"
QIoyfw_WjGg,128.56,"perhaps and they just spend all their"
QIoyfw_WjGg,130.399,"money on upgrading their parts and"
QIoyfw_WjGg,132.239,"upgrading their bikes and making them"
QIoyfw_WjGg,134.16,"super shiny and standing out because"
QIoyfw_WjGg,136.0,"this is like their way of living this is"
QIoyfw_WjGg,138.56,"their tradition this is what's cool in"
QIoyfw_WjGg,140.16,"their world so i get that i understand"
QIoyfw_WjGg,142.4,"that that being said i still don't think"
QIoyfw_WjGg,144.08,"those bikes really fit in star wars"
QIoyfw_WjGg,145.599,"anyways moving on fennec wakes up in the"
QIoyfw_WjGg,147.76,"desert by campfire with boba and he"
QIoyfw_WjGg,150.0,"tells her what happened to her and who"
QIoyfw_WjGg,151.599,"he is she figured him to be dead but"
QIoyfw_WjGg,154.0,"clearly not as they were both left for"
QIoyfw_WjGg,156.08,"dead on the sands of tatooine he tells"
QIoyfw_WjGg,158.319,"her to take the black melon and this is"
QIoyfw_WjGg,160.319,"a drink that the tuscans showed him how"
QIoyfw_WjGg,162.4,"to find and it's essentially like"
QIoyfw_WjGg,164.4,"coconut milk it hydrates you fills you"
QIoyfw_WjGg,166.4,"with nutrients and the tuscans live off"
QIoyfw_WjGg,168.64,"of this stuff among other variances of"
QIoyfw_WjGg,171.04,"sustenance he tells her how he was"
QIoyfw_WjGg,173.2,"rescued by the sand people and blames"
QIoyfw_WjGg,175.44,"himself for getting them killed by the"
QIoyfw_WjGg,177.28,"nicto bikers he blames himself because"
QIoyfw_WjGg,179.76,"of when he jumped them at toshi station"
QIoyfw_WjGg,182.159,"people there probably saw his clothing"
QIoyfw_WjGg,183.76,"and weapons and word got around you know"
QIoyfw_WjGg,185.92,"they saw his gaffy stick belonging to"
QIoyfw_WjGg,187.68,"the tuscans so they took him as a tuscan"
QIoyfw_WjGg,190.239,"as well so word gets around and with"
QIoyfw_WjGg,192.72,"conjunction of the pikes telling the"
QIoyfw_WjGg,194.879,"nicta that the tuscans have also offered"
QIoyfw_WjGg,197.44,"them safety interfering in the money"
QIoyfw_WjGg,200.0,"that the nicta gang could make"
QIoyfw_WjGg,202.0,"so the gang went out and killed them all"
QIoyfw_WjGg,204.239,"except of course the warrior woman"
QIoyfw_WjGg,206.0,"tuscan which we still have yet to be"
QIoyfw_WjGg,207.76,"seen and will probably join boba's group"
QIoyfw_WjGg,211.12,"now at this point boba and fennec decide"
QIoyfw_WjGg,213.12,"to go retrieve boba's slave one ship"
QIoyfw_WjGg,215.04,"which he calls his fire spray which is"
QIoyfw_WjGg,217.36,"the model of his ship but not the actual"
QIoyfw_WjGg,219.84,"name i feel like fennek wouldn't know"
QIoyfw_WjGg,221.68,"what the hell a slave one is even if he"
QIoyfw_WjGg,223.599,"did call it by its name but i hope they"
QIoyfw_WjGg,226.08,"still use the name in star wars because"
QIoyfw_WjGg,227.84,"it's been an iconic name for decades she"
QIoyfw_WjGg,230.959,"sends in a drone which reminds me of the"
QIoyfw_WjGg,232.799,"eye drone sent to spy on qui-gon and"
QIoyfw_WjGg,235.04,"anakin and phantom menace by darth maul"
QIoyfw_WjGg,237.84,"boba mentions to fenik that he was ready"
QIoyfw_WjGg,240.08,"to leave bounty hunting behind so i"
QIoyfw_WjGg,242.319,"guess this means that he was tired of it"
QIoyfw_WjGg,244.08,"and why he wants to become a crime lord"
QIoyfw_WjGg,245.92,"now he's tired of working for skug holes"
QIoyfw_WjGg,248.64,"fennec retrieves her drone and it"
QIoyfw_WjGg,250.48,"presents a map which reminds me of jedi"
QIoyfw_WjGg,252.799,"fallen order their plan is to sneak in"
QIoyfw_WjGg,255.76,"now i want you to watch this scene again"
QIoyfw_WjGg,258.079,"for yourself because not many will"
QIoyfw_WjGg,259.919,"recognize and if you did"
QIoyfw_WjGg,262.079,"my man fenik takes the cutter to the"
QIoyfw_WjGg,264.72,"bars and the sound is the same sound"
QIoyfw_WjGg,267.199,"when anakin takes dooku's head in"
QIoyfw_WjGg,269.28,"revenge of the sith i love how they"
QIoyfw_WjGg,271.36,"added that in there i feel like the"
QIoyfw_WjGg,272.72,"little nod to the grievous droid that we"
QIoyfw_WjGg,274.72,"see in a minute who also loses his head"
QIoyfw_WjGg,277.44,"with the same device we see the droids"
QIoyfw_WjGg,279.919,"making food and they think the noise of"
QIoyfw_WjGg,282.16,"boba and fennec is a rat so they call"
QIoyfw_WjGg,284.88,"the rat catcher droid as boba takes out"
QIoyfw_WjGg,287.04,"the first droid the other turns into a"
QIoyfw_WjGg,288.639,"general grievous spinning his arms which"
QIoyfw_WjGg,290.88,"was a beautiful little easter egg until"
QIoyfw_WjGg,293.04,"of course his head gets taken off the"
QIoyfw_WjGg,295.52,"rat hunting droid walks in and boba ends"
QIoyfw_WjGg,297.84,"up playing cat and mouse with it"
QIoyfw_WjGg,299.12,"eventually getting it where we later see"
QIoyfw_WjGg,300.88,"him in boba's palace still so he clearly"
QIoyfw_WjGg,303.28,"took to the droid and he kept him to you"
QIoyfw_WjGg,305.68,"know keep the rats out gonk droid can be"
QIoyfw_WjGg,307.84,"seen just as boba and fennec lay eyes on"
QIoyfw_WjGg,309.919,"slave one they get ambushed by the"
QIoyfw_WjGg,311.84,"guards and boba gets in the ship now"
QIoyfw_WjGg,313.919,"this is in the same position of course"
QIoyfw_WjGg,315.44,"this is like landing position but this"
QIoyfw_WjGg,317.6,"is a big callback in my mind to when"
QIoyfw_WjGg,320.32,"little boba was firing turrets on"
QIoyfw_WjGg,322.16,"obi-wan kenobi in episode 2 attack of"
QIoyfw_WjGg,324.4,"the clones with obi-wan fighting his"
QIoyfw_WjGg,327.199,"father jango fett on kamino i loved"
QIoyfw_WjGg,329.759,"seeing the console again since the"
QIoyfw_WjGg,331.199,"mandalorian fennec takes out the guards"
QIoyfw_WjGg,333.52,"in perfect assassin's style and"
QIoyfw_WjGg,335.12,"precision while boba maneuvers the ship"
QIoyfw_WjGg,337.28,"around destroying the walls until"
QIoyfw_WjGg,338.8,"finally they escape fett tells her that"
QIoyfw_WjGg,341.12,"he'll fix the ship up himself there's an"
QIoyfw_WjGg,343.199,"advantage to people thinking you're dead"
QIoyfw_WjGg,345.36,"so i think that he probably won't use"
QIoyfw_WjGg,347.68,"his ship in densely populated areas"
QIoyfw_WjGg,349.919,"because of course the galaxy knows"
QIoyfw_WjGg,351.44,"boba's ship the slave one is iconic all"
QIoyfw_WjGg,354.16,"the way from jango now in legends of"
QIoyfw_WjGg,356.4,"course there were like four different"
QIoyfw_WjGg,357.919,"fire spray ships that boba had but of"
QIoyfw_WjGg,360.72,"course in canon here it is the same one"
QIoyfw_WjGg,362.639,"that django had the slave 1 ship this"
QIoyfw_WjGg,365.199,"also makes me wonder if this is the"
QIoyfw_WjGg,366.479,"reason why boba is staying on tatooine"
QIoyfw_WjGg,369.039,"the entire time because he can't fly off"
QIoyfw_WjGg,372.24,"as people would recognize his ship and"
QIoyfw_WjGg,374.08,"know that he's alive and he's not ready"
QIoyfw_WjGg,375.84,"yet he's not at full power which he"
QIoyfw_WjGg,377.52,"finally gets to in this episode"
QIoyfw_WjGg,379.36,"boba hunts down the nicktigan who killed"
QIoyfw_WjGg,381.12,"the tuscans and absolutely obliterates"

qkmc2A3_4BM,139.12,"let's just stick with the feet taking"
qkmc2A3_4BM,140.72,"some puffy paint i'm going to seal those"

qkmc2A3_4BM,171.84,"is his earth suit"
qkmc2A3_4BM,174.72,"but it's going to be made of the galaxy"
qkmc2A3_4BM,176.959,"so that he doesn't die oh my gosh i'm"

qkmc2A3_4BM,185.2,"no but it's gonna look cute so who cares"
qkmc2A3_4BM,187.44,"usually creating the galaxy effect is so"
qkmc2A3_4BM,190.0,"quick and easy but this one was giving"
qkmc2A3_4BM,191.68,"me a little bit of a struggle i think"
qkmc2A3_4BM,193.92,"because i'm blending a warm salmon pink"
qkmc2A3_4BM,196.48,"with a with a cool blue cool purple"
qkmc2A3_4BM,198.879,"which is making them further from each"
qkmc2A3_4BM,200.64,"other on the color wheel and that's"

qkmc2A3_4BM,203.519,"they're harder to blend anyway let's"
qkmc2A3_4BM,204.959,"move on bringing in that nice bright"
qkmc2A3_4BM,207.12,"yellow over the whole face the ears and"
qkmc2A3_4BM,210.08,"then i i painted his entire arms as well"
qkmc2A3_4BM,213.04,"quickly realized how much i hate the"

qkmc2A3_4BM,458.24,"they're used they're all just kind of"
qkmc2A3_4BM,459.84,"thrown on there it's random it just"
qkmc2A3_4BM,461.84,"doesn't look like love was put in to"
qkmc2A3_4BM,464.0,"where the colors are i say this after"
qkmc2A3_4BM,465.68,"creating a psycho living meteor called"
qkmc2A3_4BM,467.919,"mr feets i do have one major problem"
qkmc2A3_4BM,470.479,"with the squishy though this plant thing"
qkmc2A3_4BM,473.039,"i don't know what it's supposed to be i"
qkmc2A3_4BM,474.56,"feel like it's gonna bite me why is its"
qkmc2A3_4BM,476.319,"mouth open it bothers me so let me get"
qkmc2A3_4BM,478.319,"to work on this one first step a nice"
qkmc2A3_4BM,480.56,"sanding"
qkmc2A3_4BM,483.94,"[Music]"
qkmc2A3_4BM,486.72,"i don't know why i felt like putting"
qkmc2A3_4BM,487.84,"that to music it just needed it time to"
qkmc2A3_4BM,489.759,"get rid of this plant so i'm gonna try"
qkmc2A3_4BM,491.44,"to cleanly cut that away and remove it"
qkmc2A3_4BM,493.599,"it did leave a slightly awkward area"
qkmc2A3_4BM,495.919,"behind but i think i can still work with"
qkmc2A3_4BM,498.08,"that i am gonna keep these leaves i'm"
qkmc2A3_4BM,499.919,"just gonna rearrange them by sticking"
qkmc2A3_4BM,501.759,"them on top of the bear's head instead"
qkmc2A3_4BM,504.24,"yes that's where they go and i'll just"
qkmc2A3_4BM,506.16,"take some puffy paint to seal the rips"
qkmc2A3_4BM,508.08,"try to cover up the rough patch where i"
qkmc2A3_4BM,510.08,"hacked those leaves off and fill any"
qkmc2A3_4BM,512.08,"gaps there we go that's looking nice on"
qkmc2A3_4BM,514.24,"to the base coat poop it's done"
qkmc2A3_4BM,516.56,"now"
qkmc2A3_4BM,518.159,"the colors for the cake i went with pink"
qkmc2A3_4BM,521.279,"that's the same as the original i"
qkmc2A3_4BM,522.959,"thought this was a makeover you terrible"
qkmc2A3_4BM,524.959,"human being you're the worst and we all"
qkmc2A3_4BM,527.2,"hate you not so fast we went from bubble"
qkmc2A3_4BM,529.44,"gum pink to a dark salmon pink okay i"
qkmc2A3_4BM,532.64,"think before it kind of had like a"
qkmc2A3_4BM,534.0,"cotton candy vibe and now i'm switching"
qkmc2A3_4BM,536.399,"it to like a fruit vibe so i went with a"
qkmc2A3_4BM,538.64,"light orange for the frosting which"
qkmc2A3_4BM,540.56,"makes for a very interesting color"
qkmc2A3_4BM,542.24,"combination that i wouldn't do very"
qkmc2A3_4BM,544.24,"often but i wanted to do something a"
qkmc2A3_4BM,546.08,"little different and this was all"
qkmc2A3_4BM,547.519,"inspired by the simple movement of the"
qkmc2A3_4BM,550.08,"leaves from the hands to the head"
qkmc2A3_4BM,552.16,"because now clearly the bear is an"
qkmc2A3_4BM,554.48,"orange obviously so i'm painting him"
qkmc2A3_4BM,556.8,"accordingly he's an orange bear sitting"
qkmc2A3_4BM,559.279,"on a fruitcake or sitting in i guess his"
qkmc2A3_4BM,561.6,"body is inside the cake or he does have"
qkmc2A3_4BM,564.0,"a body right the cake is strawberry"
qkmc2A3_4BM,565.68,"flavored the frosting is orange cream i"
qkmc2A3_4BM,568.88,"don't really know what that means it's"
qkmc2A3_4BM,570.32,"light orange and then i'm throwing in"
qkmc2A3_4BM,572.32,"some little fruit chunks in the cake"
qkmc2A3_4BM,574.959,"it makes it look a little bit odd i was"
qkmc2A3_4BM,576.959,"hoping painting the leaves in the same"
qkmc2A3_4BM,579.44,"green color would make the green chunks"
qkmc2A3_4BM,581.44,"look a little less jarring because they"
qkmc2A3_4BM,583.36,"are really jumping at you finally i'm"
qkmc2A3_4BM,585.44,"adding some simple little details to"
qkmc2A3_4BM,587.76,"finish off the orange bear which did not"
qkmc2A3_4BM,590.24,"include a mouth poor guy i just thought"
qkmc2A3_4BM,592.08,"he looked cute without it here's the"
qkmc2A3_4BM,593.76,"transformation the new version it's a"
qkmc2A3_4BM,596.0,"bit strange personally i do like it"
qkmc2A3_4BM,598.24,"better but i feel like there are going"
qkmc2A3_4BM,600.0,"to be a lot of people who actually"
qkmc2A3_4BM,601.76,"prefer the original and that's okay i'm"
qkmc2A3_4BM,604.079,"not gonna cry about that if you wanna"
qkmc2A3_4BM,606.0,"like the original better and disregard"
qkmc2A3_4BM,608.399,"all my hard work like it's trash that's"
qkmc2A3_4BM,611.04,"fine in fact i'm super happy with that i"
qkmc2A3_4BM,614.0,"think what makes it weird is the fruit"
qkmc2A3_4BM,616.0,"chunks they're a little loud i do like"
qkmc2A3_4BM,617.76,"the little bear although not quite sure"
qkmc2A3_4BM,619.68,"why he's holding his hands like that"
qkmc2A3_4BM,621.12,"what are you doing bud now if you are"
qkmc2A3_4BM,623.519,"wonderful you may remember squishy"
qkmc2A3_4BM,625.44,"makeover number 29 from several months"
qkmc2A3_4BM,628.0,"ago at this point in that video i got"
qkmc2A3_4BM,630.0,"very caught up on creating winifred and"
qkmc2A3_4BM,632.16,"then as a result i needed to create her"
qkmc2A3_4BM,634.399,"companion wilfred and then i didn't have"
qkmc2A3_4BM,636.959,"time to edit the last squishy that i"
qkmc2A3_4BM,638.959,"painted which was this apple squishy so"
qkmc2A3_4BM,641.6,"i said that i would just add the apple"
qkmc2A3_4BM,643.12,"footage into the next squishy makeover"
qkmc2A3_4BM,645.2,"but then the next squishy makeover was"
qkmc2A3_4BM,647.519,"all about my custom animal set because"
qkmc2A3_4BM,649.6,"of my nail polish gosh this girl talks a"
qkmc2A3_4BM,652.0,"lot so it's got pushed off until now and"
qkmc2A3_4BM,655.839,"this is that footage from several months"
qkmc2A3_4BM,657.68,"ago i'll try to remember what's going on"
qkmc2A3_4BM,659.68,"here so yes this is the apple squishy"
qkmc2A3_4BM,662.079,"and it's actually a squishy that i"
qkmc2A3_4BM,664.079,"bought a really long time ago and i do"
qkmc2A3_4BM,666.16,"remember the idea that i had for this"
qkmc2A3_4BM,668.079,"squishy at the time so i decided to dig"
qkmc2A3_4BM,670.959,"it out and make my old dream come alive"
qkmc2A3_4BM,673.76,"it's clearly a very plain and ordinary"
qkmc2A3_4BM,676.0,"squishy oh i'm squishing faces into it"
qkmc2A3_4BM,678.8,"oh oh that's horrible all right let's"
qkmc2A3_4BM,681.12,"get into it i went ahead and cut off the"
qkmc2A3_4BM,683.12,"little rough seams and then took some"
qkmc2A3_4BM,685.12,"sandpaper to it and oh ooh i'm opening a"
qkmc2A3_4BM,687.839,"drawer why am i opening a drawer oh"
qkmc2A3_4BM,690.0,"that's right um ignore the child"
qkmc2A3_4BM,691.839,"barrettes i grabbed one of my paper"
qkmc2A3_4BM,694.079,"sticks from my hoard of paper sticks"
qkmc2A3_4BM,696.959,"doesn't everyone have one of those yeah"
qkmc2A3_4BM,699.12,"no"
qkmc2A3_4BM,700.0,"this one looks perfect and i'm gonna"
qkmc2A3_4BM,701.6,"take that stick and just beat the apple"
qkmc2A3_4BM,703.92,"with it no i'm kidding i'm just gonna"
qkmc2A3_4BM,705.92,"stab the apple with it oh that's not"
qkmc2A3_4BM,707.76,"working okay so let me go ahead and get"
qkmc2A3_4BM,709.36,"my scissors out and i'll just cut a"
qkmc2A3_4BM,711.12,"little opening oh gross"
qkmc2A3_4BM,713.68,"that looks gross then stab the apple"
qkmc2A3_4BM,715.92,"again this is uncomfortable and there we"
qkmc2A3_4BM,718.079,"go i'll just secure that in place with a"
qkmc2A3_4BM,719.92,"little paint and let that dry now we get"
qkmc2A3_4BM,722.56,"into the makeover i'm going to take this"
qkmc2A3_4BM,724.399,"red apple and paint it are you ready red"
qkmc2A3_4BM,727.519,"wow"
qkmc2A3_4BM,728.48,"wow not that different i know although i"
qkmc2A3_4BM,731.12,"did add a little gradient to the bottom"
qkmc2A3_4BM,732.959,"to make it a little bit more interesting"
qkmc2A3_4BM,734.639,"than before and i painted the stem in a"
qkmc2A3_4BM,736.88,"lighter of a brown to make it a little"
qkmc2A3_4BM,738.72,"cuter now here's where things go real"
qkmc2A3_4BM,740.959,"crazy i'm adding some chocolate sauce on"
qkmc2A3_4BM,742.959,"top of the apple so this is a candy"
qkmc2A3_4BM,745.12,"apple you know it's a very simple design"
qkmc2A3_4BM,747.44,"idea but to be fair this idea does come"
qkmc2A3_4BM,749.839,"from a much simpler time okay i came up"
qkmc2A3_4BM,752.399,"with this idea before i was cutting"
qkmc2A3_4BM,754.32,"things up and gluing them together and"
qkmc2A3_4BM,756.0,"rearranging them and changing them and"
qkmc2A3_4BM,757.76,"my designs overall were just much more"
qkmc2A3_4BM,759.68,"basic so i thought about changing my"
qkmc2A3_4BM,761.92,"original idea and doing something more"
qkmc2A3_4BM,763.92,"on par with what i currently do but i"
qkmc2A3_4BM,766.32,"kind of like the idea of sticking with"
qkmc2A3_4BM,767.92,"my original plan for this squishy even"
qkmc2A3_4BM,770.24,"though it's so many years later maybe"
qkmc2A3_4BM,772.079,"it's sentimental i don't know but it's"
qkmc2A3_4BM,774.079,"sweet and then of course it's time for"
qkmc2A3_4BM,775.76,"sprinkles"
qkmc2A3_4BM,778.35,"[Music]"
qkmc2A3_4BM,781.6,"beautiful and here's the before and"
qkmc2A3_4BM,783.76,"after now the only differences are a"
qkmc2A3_4BM,785.839,"stick some chocolate and a couple"
qkmc2A3_4BM,787.76,"sprinkles but i do like the additions"
qkmc2A3_4BM,790.639,"it's much more my style you may notice i"
qkmc2A3_4BM,793.04,"didn't place the sprinkles individually"
qkmc2A3_4BM,795.12,"i just kind of tossed them on there"
qkmc2A3_4BM,796.8,"watching this back i'm kind of surprised"
qkmc2A3_4BM,798.88,"at my past self how could you but i must"
qkmc2A3_4BM,801.76,"admit i do kind of like the more natural"
qkmc2A3_4BM,804.16,"look of scattering the sprinkles"
qkmc2A3_4BM,805.92,"randomly everywhere this time it almost"
qkmc2A3_4BM,808.32,"looks real alright and those are the"
qkmc2A3_4BM,810.0,"three squishies for today i feel like"
qkmc2A3_4BM,811.76,"this is a very odd mix i mean they're"
qkmc2A3_4BM,814.079,"all a little bit strange and different"
qkmc2A3_4BM,816.32,"than what i'd normally do in their own"
qkmc2A3_4BM,818.079,"little ways"
qkmc2A3_4BM,819.199,"but then as a group they just look even"
qkmc2A3_4BM,821.44,"more strange all together thanks again"

QoX4Xe2gqV4,5.28,"And this is our Free Fem krav Maga project!"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,11.68,"— We're going to tell you how to punch,"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,15.745,"Avoid, punish..."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,18.72,"— But honestly saying, we will tell you how to defend yourself right"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,21.9,"In some emergency and unpleasant cases when it seems there's no way out,"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,25.9,"but it actually exists."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,28.02,"— And we will start.. or actually continue with the knee strike to groin"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,33.74,"that solves issues in close distance."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,40.22,"— I'm going to show you what knee strike is on Sasha :)"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,42.98,"— So what's that? Show me!"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,46.115,"Well, it's a really strong attack"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,48.92,"that is capable of refreshing your rival"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,52.5,"even if you miss his groin."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,55.0,"However if you put your weight in it right"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,58.3,"a person that gets it won't be pleased."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,60.94,"If it hits ribs it breaks ribs, if it hits face it breaks face, if it hits groin..."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,69.34,"— So the area of impact is a place a bit above our knee"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,74.42,"It's here more or less"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,75.84,"We should realise that we make knee strike not with the leg only, but with all our body"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,80.18,"We have to put all our weight"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,81.76,"And also add a bit by pushing from the ground"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,83.92,"and put its combined power in our attack"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,86.86,"During the attack we rotate our hips slightly and we're striking like if with them"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,90.98,"And during this rotating move the delivering leg goes like after the hips"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,95.52,"— Chasing."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,— Chasing :),""
QoX4Xe2gqV4,102.78,"— When we're telling about controlling we have to explain why it's useful."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,106.28,"It makes the attack stronger, it helps to aim better."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,109.64,"Well, we also have to say where should we aim to."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,112.68,"After a good knee strike"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,115.375,"a man will collapse a bit"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,118.285,"He will bend or sit or will fold a different way"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,121.785,"that will allow us to get extra seconds"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,124.775,"to choose what we gonna do: run"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,127.935,"that could be a bit early"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,130.975,"or add a couple more hits to make sure"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,133.965,"we've got really enough time to run away."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,136.955,"So after getting the first knee a person"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,140.175,"is bending and we're going for control"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,143.795,"Why do we may need it? In order to attack precisely"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,147.0,"in vital points and areas."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,152.6,"— In order to perform a control of a person we put out hands on his shoulder"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,156.1,"We go for the neck from his right side with our right hand because we're hitting with right leg"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,160.7,"This is a really firm grip, our fingers together"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,164.775,"So right hand takes the neck with a hook of some sort"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,167.845,"A hook like this one"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,170.615,"Left hands takes what it could get"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,173.88,"Clothes, skin, meat,"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,176.745,"this could be a jacket."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,— ...or we just put the hand on his shoulder,""
QoX4Xe2gqV4,179.7,"— Yes, or like this, we need this hand for even more firm control"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,183.02,"Here we go..."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,185.665,"and then we kind of pull this guy on our knee"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,188.765,"So we not only attack with knee and hold the aggressor,"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,192.125,"We throw our hands with this guy down."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,195.32,"— Attack becomes way stronger"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,199.1,"— Pay attention that I put my leg back on the ground after each strike"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,203.08,"It helps to charge the next attack"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,208.3,"But what if a person comes too close"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,211.42,"And we somehow missed a moment when we could've attacked his groin."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,216.2,"Do not try to push him away."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,218.235,"It's hard to do with a guy that is twice heavier than you."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,221.995,"We put our hands down"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,224.865,"And then put them together to make a cup of some sort"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,230.085,"And perform a tiny"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,232.245,"Push in the groin."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,235.36,"We need it not to make damage,"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,237.88,"but to get some distance in order to plant several precise knee strikes afterwards"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,244.86,"In his groin area."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,247.18,"— How can we train knee strikes"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,250.48,"with a girlfriend or even alone at home?"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,254.44,"— This kind of equipment is used in Israeli army by soldiers"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,257.5,"to grind some techniques if they've got no"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,260.78,"special... bags or..."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,263.6,"dummies."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,264.94,"— Dummies?! XD"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,266.6,"Aye, soldier friends of both sexes!"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,270.38,"— Aye-aye!"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,271.365,"So they use backpacks filled up with something"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,274.405,"like rags or covers. Or they use sleeping bags.It's a nice option."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,277.38,"It's only flaw is that it's a bit too light, but backpack"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,280.78,"filled up with something hard is a perfect option."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,283.4,"Also one more thing"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,284.98,"If you're going to use backpack as kickball, please notice"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,288.22,"that all these fasteners and closings may damage your legs"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,291.18,"So it's better to use its backside."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,298.9,"— Eh, thank you!.."
QoX4Xe2gqV4,300.02,"That I'm still alive XD"
QoX4Xe2gqV4,303.08,"This were Katya"

rssBd3fX8fw,15.52,"it's not just a case of finding"
rssBd3fX8fw,one of each design:,""
rssBd3fX8fw,18.08,"you also want each value"
rssBd3fX8fw,from each year.,""
rssBd3fX8fw,21.04,"But in 1933, Britain didn't"
rssBd3fX8fw,need any more pennies.,""
rssBd3fX8fw,24.48,"There were plenty in circulation,"
rssBd3fX8fw,25.76,"so the Royal Mint,"
rssBd3fX8fw,who make - or "mint" - coins,,""
rssBd3fX8fw,28.56,"decided they wouldn't make"
rssBd3fX8fw,any one-pence coins that year.,""
rssBd3fX8fw,31.92,"That's not unusual,"
rssBd3fX8fw,it had happened before.,""
rssBd3fX8fw,33.92,"Trouble is, King George V needed some."
rssBd3fX8fw,36.48,"It was tradition for the King to bury"
rssBd3fX8fw,a full set of new coins from that year,""
rssBd3fX8fw,40.56,"in the foundations of new and important"
rssBd3fX8fw,buildings as they were constructed,,""
rssBd3fX8fw,43.84,"and you couldn't use old coins for that."
rssBd3fX8fw,46.56,"So the Royal Mint did make"
rssBd3fX8fw,some 1933 pennies.,""
rssBd3fX8fw,50.48,"No-one actually kept the records"
rssBd3fX8fw,51.68,"of how many there were,"
rssBd3fX8fw,but it was probably...,""
rssBd3fX8fw,54.055,"seven."
rssBd3fX8fw,55.12,"Which means that while the face value"
rssBd3fX8fw,of those seven coins is a penny,,""
rssBd3fX8fw,59.12,"they're so rare that the price"
rssBd3fX8fw,at auction these days,""
rssBd3fX8fw,61.76,"is easily more than £100,000."
rssBd3fX8fw,64.96,"And over at a London coin dealership,"
rssBd3fX8fw,I got to see one of them.,""
rssBd3fX8fw,68.28,"- This is from a private collection,"
rssBd3fX8fw,70.32,"one that's been loaned to us very kindly."
rssBd3fX8fw,72.8,"It's great because it's such an iconic coin,"
rssBd3fX8fw,75.52,"we get a lot of visitors coming to see it."
rssBd3fX8fw,77.76,"Usually these coins disappear into safes"
rssBd3fX8fw,and they're never seen again.,""
rssBd3fX8fw,81.6,"The last sold in 2016 for a hammer price"
rssBd3fX8fw,of around £140,000.,""
rssBd3fX8fw,88.56,"It's the first time one's been sold"

rssBd3fX8fw,92.08,"and one would imagine, if it was"
rssBd3fX8fw,to come on the market again,,""
rssBd3fX8fw,95.2,"it would sell for even higher."
rssBd3fX8fw,96.8,"- So there are probably seven 1933 pennies."
rssBd3fX8fw,100.24,"Three are in private collections"
rssBd3fX8fw,I got to film one of those.,""
rssBd3fX8fw, ,""

rssBd3fX8fw, ,""
rssBd3fX8fw,105.44,"...well, that's the possible heist movie."
rssBd3fX8fw,107.76,"Because remember, the king"
rssBd3fX8fw,buried some of the coins.,""
rssBd3fX8fw,111.6,"One of them was buried under this church"
rssBd3fX8fw,in Middleton, West Yorkshire.,""
rssBd3fX8fw,114.96,"I say "was" because in 1970,"
rssBd3fX8fw,it was stolen.,""
rssBd3fX8fw,118.32,"Whereabouts still unknown,"
rssBd3fX8fw,although presumably,""
rssBd3fX8fw,120.16,"if someone in Yorkshire finds a 1933 penny"
rssBd3fX8fw,in their grandparents' coin collection,,""
rssBd3fX8fw,123.68,"there'll be a bit of suspicion."
rssBd3fX8fw,And after this theft...,""
rssBd3fX8fw,126.48,"...the local bishop ordered that"
rssBd3fX8fw,the coins under this church,""
rssBd3fX8fw,128.96,"should be dug up and sold"
rssBd3fX8fw,130.32,"in order to prevent them"
rssBd3fX8fw,falling into the hands of thieves.,""
rssBd3fX8fw,133.36,"That's one of the pennies that's"
rssBd3fX8fw,in private hands legally now.,""
rssBd3fX8fw,136.56,"Which means there is one building"
rssBd3fX8fw,and one buried coin left.,""
rssBd3fX8fw,140.96,"The last 1933 penny is buried somewhere"
rssBd3fX8fw,under the foundations of Senate House,,""
rssBd3fX8fw,145.92,"at the University of London."
rssBd3fX8fw,147.36,"Or at least, everyone thinks it is."
rssBd3fX8fw,149.12,"No-one's checked since 1933,"
rssBd3fX8fw,you'd have to dig it up.,""
rssBd3fX8fw,151.6,"And I doubt anyone actually knows"
rssBd3fX8fw,exactly where it's buried,,""
rssBd3fX8fw,154.64,"unless they've done a huge amount of research"
rssBd3fX8fw,and found some original blueprints.,""
rssBd3fX8fw,157.68,"Which, to be clear, I haven't."
rssBd3fX8fw,And besides, according to the university,,""
rssBd3fX8fw,160.8,"the whole package is buried very deep,"
rssBd3fX8fw,not exactly where you'd expect,,""
rssBd3fX8fw,163.92,"which does sound like"
rssBd3fX8fw,what someone would write,""
rssBd3fX8fw,165.76,"if they were trying to discourage"
rssBd3fX8fw,amateur treasure-hunting thieves.,""
rssBd3fX8fw,168.72,"But Senate House is right here,"
rssBd3fX8fw,in the middle of London.,""
rssBd3fX8fw,171.36,"There is some construction around here today,"

rssBd3fX8fw,180.16,"well, I don't have a plan for you."
rssBd3fX8fw,181.84,"And I don't recommend anyone try it for real."

S25R6a6FsxQ,234.56,"gets infected by cancer and part of this"
S25R6a6FsxQ,236.959,"is because bobby kotec himself has been"

SChILENNM-s,105.92,"try to do it they might try to do is"
SChILENNM-s,107.06,"like I said there's about three things"
SChILENNM-s,108.5,"the first is she felt my body weight"
SChILENNM-s,111.17,"start to sit up which is an indicator"
SChILENNM-s,113.99,"that I'm sitting up to get leverage to"
SChILENNM-s,116.149,"potentially start to try to hit her or"
SChILENNM-s,118.21,"smack her now the second she felt me"
SChILENNM-s,121.549,"starting to sit up"
SChILENNM-s,122.72,"she reached around and hugged my body as"
SChILENNM-s,125.03,"tight as she possibly could now see when"
SChILENNM-s,127.939,"she's doing this this alone I could"
SChILENNM-s,129.829,"still try to sit up throw a weight back"
SChILENNM-s,131.66,"and access her head but at the same time"
SChILENNM-s,133.76,"as she grabbed my body pulled her head"
SChILENNM-s,135.59,"tight she used her legs and she pushed"
SChILENNM-s,138.769,"me forward and pulled with her arms so I"
SChILENNM-s,141.35,"sign up she drives me this is forcing my"
SChILENNM-s,144.769,"body weight down now watch I try to sit"
SChILENNM-s,146.75,"up again and she pushes again now during"
SChILENNM-s,151.16,"this process when she feels like I burnt"
SChILENNM-s,153.049,"a little bit of energy or she's got"
SChILENNM-s,154.549,"opportunity she's got my weight forward"
SChILENNM-s,156.95,"I'm still trying to sit up on her but"
SChILENNM-s,159.799,"what she does is when she feels it right"
SChILENNM-s,161.959,"she reaches one hand to my shoulder at a"
SChILENNM-s,164.269,"time one hand at a time that way if I"
SChILENNM-s,167.299,"tried to sit up she can still pull down"
SChILENNM-s,169.88,"into me so she gets one hand to the"
SChILENNM-s,172.489,"shoulder then she got the other hand to"
SChILENNM-s,174.32,"the shoulder one at a time now if I'm"
SChILENNM-s,176.66,"trying to sit up this actually works to"
SChILENNM-s,178.31,"her advantage because it creates space"
SChILENNM-s,180.47,"for her to loop her arm over"
SChILENNM-s,182.89,"hop and reach in and grab as deep as she"
SChILENNM-s,185.77,"can to her own jacket she pins her elbow"
SChILENNM-s,188.74,"to her body and look what you did she"
SChILENNM-s,191.47,"stepped over and hooked my foot now she"
SChILENNM-s,193.81,"has two legs on this side of my body"
SChILENNM-s,196.75,"trip I leg on my arm now what she does"
SChILENNM-s,199.81,"is she explodes her body weight up and"
SChILENNM-s,202.09,"she drives me over now I'm going to go"
SChILENNM-s,204.82,"back here for a second has a little head"
SChILENNM-s,206.56,"but try to look roller most people would"
SChILENNM-s,210.7,"think right here go ahead and wrap the"
SChILENNM-s,212.47,"arm she's got the arm and a leg think"
SChILENNM-s,214.54,"there's no way I'm going to get a"
SChILENNM-s,215.59,"heavier person over now watch the"
SChILENNM-s,218.08,"difference is I'm not just lying here"
SChILENNM-s,220.09,"I'm actually trying to get up when she"
SChILENNM-s,223.12,"locks my arm my instinct is to try to"
SChILENNM-s,225.43,"pull the arm away it's in these moments"
SChILENNM-s,227.38,"when I'm moving my own weight that she"
SChILENNM-s,229.81,"pushes that rule my weight over the"
SChILENNM-s,232.93,"second we got over she put in a little"
SChILENNM-s,235.0,"headbutt boom okay I would turn the head"
SChILENNM-s,237.58,"a little bit to the side so that the"
SChILENNM-s,239.019,"face is protected its boom and right"
SChILENNM-s,241.36,"away she sits back frames the legs open"
SChILENNM-s,244.15,"she puts a hit into the growing for good"
SChILENNM-s,245.86,"measure and then backs up okay"
SChILENNM-s,251.99,"so the Mount escape just real quick one"
SChILENNM-s,255.17,"more time there's a couple key elements"
SChILENNM-s,256.76,"one ladies practice this husbands"
SChILENNM-s,260.24,"boyfriends don't just sit on top of your"
SChILENNM-s,263.75,"girlfriends and wives and say he'll go"
SChILENNM-s,265.73,"ahead and try to move my body weight I'm"
SChILENNM-s,267.17,"too heavy for you my weight is sitting"
SChILENNM-s,269.09,"back you're not simulating anything all"
SChILENNM-s,270.74,"you're doing is teaching them that they"
SChILENNM-s,271.82,"can't protect themselves I'm not saying"
SChILENNM-s,273.98,"you have to give it to them but I'm"
SChILENNM-s,275.09,"saying help learn help them learn the"
SChILENNM-s,277.7,"technique if I was sitting down and I"
SChILENNM-s,280.4,"went to sit up to try to hit her okay"
SChILENNM-s,283.34,"that's when my body weight is not a"
SChILENNM-s,285.35,"hundred percent on I'm trying to sit up"
SChILENNM-s,287.0,"to think about hitting you're in a"
SChILENNM-s,288.86,"precarious position it's much easier to"
SChILENNM-s,291.14,"throw them off because I have an agenda"
SChILENNM-s,292.67,"trying to hit okay once she pulled like"
SChILENNM-s,295.73,"that one arm at a time once you got"
SChILENNM-s,297.89,"their weight down quickly shoot one arm"
SChILENNM-s,299.9,"to shoulder other arm up to the shoulder"
SChILENNM-s,301.79,"and then wiggle your body up a little"
SChILENNM-s,304.58,"bit is they're trying to sit up look at"
SChILENNM-s,306.02,"that she went over talk to rap and then"
SChILENNM-s,308.6,"steps to block my foot and then pushes"
SChILENNM-s,311.18,"and boom head button oh here we go oh"
SChILENNM-s,316.24,"okay all right everybody Thank You"

SepGOCEin9Q,0.08,"this is super important as a beginner"
SepGOCEin9Q,3.28,"because you want to know"
SepGOCEin9Q,5.12,"how deep in the you are"
SepGOCEin9Q,8.4,"and where to go in order to get a better"
SepGOCEin9Q,12.0,"position"
SepGOCEin9Q,12.88,"and when you find your passion it"
SepGOCEin9Q,14.32,"ignites you as a person"
SepGOCEin9Q,16.64,"you just feel awesome"
SepGOCEin9Q,21.279,"in my first video we covered over the"
SepGOCEin9Q,23.68,"top side positions so"
SepGOCEin9Q,25.439,"if we pictured our jiu jitsu game like a"
SepGOCEin9Q,27.359,"tree we went from"
SepGOCEin9Q,28.96,"the ground level all the way to the"
SepGOCEin9Q,30.48,"treetop now in this video we're going to"
SepGOCEin9Q,32.88,"cover"
SepGOCEin9Q,33.44,"the bottom positions so from ground"
SepGOCEin9Q,36.239,"level"
SepGOCEin9Q,37.04,"to deeper roots even deeper roots and"
SepGOCEin9Q,39.68,"basically bj"
SepGOCEin9Q,40.96,"j hello the reason why these positions"
SepGOCEin9Q,45.52,"are"
SepGOCEin9Q,45.76,"ordered in the way that they are ordered"
SepGOCEin9Q,48.32,"is based off of"
SepGOCEin9Q,49.52,"positional advantage parameters so while"
SepGOCEin9Q,52.559,"i'm on the bottom"
SepGOCEin9Q,53.44,"gary's going to be on top i'm going to"
SepGOCEin9Q,55.039,"go over the five"
SepGOCEin9Q,57.12,"advantages that he's going to have"
SepGOCEin9Q,67.119,"being on the top side so basically he's"
SepGOCEin9Q,69.04,"going to have gravity he's going to have"
SepGOCEin9Q,70.96,"torso control"
SepGOCEin9Q,72.0,"he's going to have freedom of the arms"
SepGOCEin9Q,74.0,"back exposure and mobility those are his"
SepGOCEin9Q,76.0,"parameters of control that he's going to"
SepGOCEin9Q,77.92,"try to use"
SepGOCEin9Q,78.799,"on me to better his position and worsen"
SepGOCEin9Q,82.32,"mine"
SepGOCEin9Q,83.119,"and being on these bottom side like from"
SepGOCEin9Q,86.24,"hell all the way to ground"
SepGOCEin9Q,87.68,"you're basically fighting to eliminate"
SepGOCEin9Q,90.479,"his parameters of control"
SepGOCEin9Q,92.159,"and get your own parameters of control"
SepGOCEin9Q,95.04,"so basically try to get to the top side"
SepGOCEin9Q,97.36,"and try to get in least and least sucky"
SepGOCEin9Q,99.52,"positions"
SepGOCEin9Q,100.799,"um because you you don't wanna you don't"
SepGOCEin9Q,105.439,"you don't you yeah yeah if they have"
SepGOCEin9Q,108.159,"knee to belly you don't want them to"
SepGOCEin9Q,109.92,"take your back you know what i mean"
SepGOCEin9Q,111.2,"you need to know the framework that way"
SepGOCEin9Q,113.759,"you know which direction you're going in"
SepGOCEin9Q,115.52,"and whether you're getting yourself in a"
SepGOCEin9Q,117.04,"better position or in a worse position"
SepGOCEin9Q,119.759,"um"
SepGOCEin9Q,120.24,"and as a beginner uh you're probably"
SepGOCEin9Q,122.719,"gonna be"
SepGOCEin9Q,123.36,"in these positions a lot so there are"
SepGOCEin9Q,126.0,"specific escapes to these positions"
SepGOCEin9Q,128.319,"um that i'll also like briefly mention"
SepGOCEin9Q,131.039,"that way you"
SepGOCEin9Q,132.16,"you're aware that they exist so let's"
SepGOCEin9Q,134.56,"let's get started"
SepGOCEin9Q,137.68,"so first we're going to start at"
SepGOCEin9Q,143.2,"let's start at ground level right so"
SepGOCEin9Q,145.44,"this is"
SepGOCEin9Q,146.959,"the best that it's going to get from"
SepGOCEin9Q,149.2,"negative positions right this is the"
SepGOCEin9Q,151.2,"least"
SepGOCEin9Q,151.68,"negative ground level from here we're"
SepGOCEin9Q,153.599,"just going to get deeper and deeper and"
SepGOCEin9Q,156.239,"eventually go to bjj hell and try to get"
SepGOCEin9Q,159.2,"out of that one"
SepGOCEin9Q,161.04,"so from here"
SepGOCEin9Q,166.239,"from here gary's in my guard right and a"
SepGOCEin9Q,169.44,"lot of a lot of jiu jitsu attacks are"
SepGOCEin9Q,171.44,"actually from here right like this"
SepGOCEin9Q,173.76,"in in terms of sucky positions this is"
SepGOCEin9Q,175.84,"probably the least"
SepGOCEin9Q,176.8,"sucky there's definitely a bunch of"
SepGOCEin9Q,178.879,"other places i'd rather be"
SepGOCEin9Q,180.239,"from here um but at least i have like a"
SepGOCEin9Q,182.8,"little bit of torso control like that"
SepGOCEin9Q,185.519,"but basically i mean we're we're just"
SepGOCEin9Q,187.92,"like in"
SepGOCEin9Q,189.28,"on the ground like this isn't a great"
SepGOCEin9Q,192.48,"position to be in i mean as a beginner"
SepGOCEin9Q,194.959,"i would definitely develop ways to get"
SepGOCEin9Q,197.92,"higher into that tree"
SepGOCEin9Q,199.76,"and basically to the tree top like in my"
SepGOCEin9Q,201.84,"last video"
SepGOCEin9Q,202.879,"then stick around here like this"
SepGOCEin9Q,206.0,"is an airbag right would you stop a car"
SepGOCEin9Q,209.28,"by using the airbag no like this is like"
SepGOCEin9Q,214.239,"not the best position to be in so as a"
SepGOCEin9Q,216.799,"beginner"
SepGOCEin9Q,218.08,"i would advise not to spend too much"
SepGOCEin9Q,219.84,"time going for"
SepGOCEin9Q,221.2,"or learning submissions like from here"
SepGOCEin9Q,224.0,"if"
SepGOCEin9Q,225.36,"as opposed to trying to advance"
SepGOCEin9Q,227.599,"positionally"
SepGOCEin9Q,229.04,"um but from here you know in terms of"
SepGOCEin9Q,230.879,"like self defense as a female there's"
SepGOCEin9Q,232.48,"some cool things you can do you know you"
SepGOCEin9Q,234.0,"can do collar chokes"
SepGOCEin9Q,235.599,"you can do a triangle"
SepGOCEin9Q,239.04,"right in terms of like female self"
SepGOCEin9Q,240.56,"defense this is a pretty cool position"
SepGOCEin9Q,245.2,"but from here gary is most likely going"
SepGOCEin9Q,247.68,"to try to advance"
SepGOCEin9Q,249.12,"and as he advances my position is"
SepGOCEin9Q,251.519,"actually going to get"
SepGOCEin9Q,252.4,"lower and lower so one half lower of a"
SepGOCEin9Q,256.079,"position"
SepGOCEin9Q,256.959,"to be in would be half guard"
SepGOCEin9Q,262.8,"right so this is half guard and let's"
SepGOCEin9Q,265.28,"say gary passes"
SepGOCEin9Q,270.56,"and right now i am in gary's"
SepGOCEin9Q,273.68,"side control and this sucks"
SepGOCEin9Q,276.72,"this is like the first route heading"
SepGOCEin9Q,279.759,"towards bjj hell like"
SepGOCEin9Q,282.0,"you have somebody on top of you so they"
SepGOCEin9Q,283.84,"have a parameter of control"
SepGOCEin9Q,285.68,"of gravity they have torso control"
SepGOCEin9Q,288.96,"and from here you your primary goal"
SepGOCEin9Q,292.08,"is to escape and either try to replace"
SepGOCEin9Q,295.44,"the guard"
SepGOCEin9Q,296.0,"or maybe get half guard or just get"
SepGOCEin9Q,297.68,"higher on"
SepGOCEin9Q,299.28,"from the root to basically the ground so"
SepGOCEin9Q,302.639,"from here you know you can like start to"
SepGOCEin9Q,305.759,"escape"
SepGOCEin9Q,306.56,"but he's going to want to try to advance"
SepGOCEin9Q,309.919,"so from here"
SepGOCEin9Q,311.52,"you do not want to let this happen"
SepGOCEin9Q,314.72,"so go need a stomach"
SepGOCEin9Q,317.84,"he is going to try to get knee to"
SepGOCEin9Q,319.28,"stomach if you are in somebody's side"
SepGOCEin9Q,322.24,"control"
SepGOCEin9Q,323.6,"and they get knee to stomach you just"
SepGOCEin9Q,325.44,"went even further"
SepGOCEin9Q,326.96,"down the roots right do not"
SepGOCEin9Q,330.479,"let them get knee to stomach on you"
SepGOCEin9Q,333.6,"um there's a couple of like techniques"
SepGOCEin9Q,334.96,"that you can do in order to avoid this"
SepGOCEin9Q,336.96,"like i'll just show one like real quick"
SepGOCEin9Q,339.44,"but"
SepGOCEin9Q,340.4,"so from here basically if you can get"
SepGOCEin9Q,343.52,"your knee and elbow together"
SepGOCEin9Q,345.039,"to block this from even happening just"
SepGOCEin9Q,347.12,"keep that in mind but if they get knee"
SepGOCEin9Q,348.96,"to belly on you"
SepGOCEin9Q,350.88,"from side control you just went down"
SepGOCEin9Q,354.16,"you went down to like the second level"
SepGOCEin9Q,356.4,"of roots"
SepGOCEin9Q,357.68,"from here you need to escape"
SepGOCEin9Q,361.36,"so learning need a stomach escapes or"
SepGOCEin9Q,363.919,"neon belly escapes"
SepGOCEin9Q,365.44,"or escapes that prevent this from even"
SepGOCEin9Q,368.24,"happening in the first place like"
SepGOCEin9Q,369.6,"putting your knee"
SepGOCEin9Q,370.72,"to your elbow is key so from"
SepGOCEin9Q,373.919,"here if he gets mount"
SepGOCEin9Q,378.4,"if gary mounts me oh my god"
SepGOCEin9Q,381.52,"you are even worse like you are like"
SepGOCEin9Q,385.199,"one level from bjj hell like this is bad"
SepGOCEin9Q,389.199,"this is very bad he has gravity"
SepGOCEin9Q,392.319,"he has torso control he has freedom of"
SepGOCEin9Q,394.72,"his arms"
SepGOCEin9Q,396.24,"i mean this is like this is a sucky"
SepGOCEin9Q,399.199,"position to be in"
SepGOCEin9Q,400.639,"so from here especially as a beginner"
SepGOCEin9Q,403.6,"like you're going to want to know how to"
SepGOCEin9Q,405.6,"escape"
SepGOCEin9Q,406.24,"mount and you're going to want to know"
SepGOCEin9Q,408.4,"how to escape mount how to escape me to"
SepGOCEin9Q,410.319,"stomach"
SepGOCEin9Q,411.36,"um and so i want to prevent them from"
SepGOCEin9Q,413.919,"passing"
SepGOCEin9Q,414.479,"your guard so from here you know there's"
SepGOCEin9Q,416.96,"a couple of escapes"
SepGOCEin9Q,418.56,"you can do"
SepGOCEin9Q,425.759,"so the most common escape is a bridge"
SepGOCEin9Q,427.52,"and roll um"
SepGOCEin9Q,429.44,"but from here you do not"
SepGOCEin9Q,432.639,"want to get even lower so bjj hell"
SepGOCEin9Q,438.88,"is when you might even see this on mma"
SepGOCEin9Q,441.199,"fights so"
SepGOCEin9Q,442.16,"they're in if they ever roll over"
SepGOCEin9Q,445.599,"like that"
SepGOCEin9Q,449.68,"if you are doing jiu jitsu and you are"
SepGOCEin9Q,452.24,"in this position if you have"
SepGOCEin9Q,454.56,"if somebody has taken your back this"
SepGOCEin9Q,457.599,"is bad especially if you're flattened"
SepGOCEin9Q,459.599,"out this is the worst"
SepGOCEin9Q,461.919,"position you can ever be in"
SepGOCEin9Q,465.28,"in bjj don't don't be here right"
SepGOCEin9Q,468.879,"and then even they can even take your"
SepGOCEin9Q,470.319,"back"
SepGOCEin9Q,472.479,"and you can be in positions like this"
SepGOCEin9Q,474.08,"and have your back taken"
SepGOCEin9Q,476.16,"this this is bad you do not want to be"
SepGOCEin9Q,479.44,"here"
SepGOCEin9Q,480.319,"right this is i have my back taken this"
SepGOCEin9Q,482.8,"is bjj hell"
SepGOCEin9Q,484.24,"this is the worst position on the whole"
SepGOCEin9Q,487.84,"entire tree"
SepGOCEin9Q,489.12,"you're underground you're in bjj hell"
SepGOCEin9Q,491.84,"pass the roots"
SepGOCEin9Q,493.199,"all the way down so as a beginner"
SepGOCEin9Q,499.199,"if you are if somebody is in your guard"
SepGOCEin9Q,502.479,"and they pass your guard"
SepGOCEin9Q,510.479,"if somebody is past your guard and"
SepGOCEin9Q,512.159,"they're inside control you just went"
SepGOCEin9Q,514.88,"to a deeper root level if they're in"
SepGOCEin9Q,517.36,"side control and they get knee to belly"
SepGOCEin9Q,519.279,"or need a stomach"
SepGOCEin9Q,520.32,"same thing"
SepGOCEin9Q,525.92,"you just went down further right from"
SepGOCEin9Q,527.92,"there if they get the mount"
SepGOCEin9Q,530.24,"then they have a bunch of parameters of"
SepGOCEin9Q,532.72,"control"
SepGOCEin9Q,533.6,"right they have torso control they have"
SepGOCEin9Q,536.16,"gravity control they can like"
SepGOCEin9Q,538.24,"use their arms to do a whole bunch of"
SepGOCEin9Q,541.839,"stuff to you"
SepGOCEin9Q,549.76,"and then from there if you give them"
SepGOCEin9Q,551.76,"your back that's the fifth parameter"
SepGOCEin9Q,554.16,"of control right there which is um"
SepGOCEin9Q,557.519,"you know back exposure"
SepGOCEin9Q,566.64,"which you definitely don't want that to"
SepGOCEin9Q,568.64,"happen"
SepGOCEin9Q,570.8,"and so as a beginner um you definitely"
SepGOCEin9Q,574.08,"want to be aware"
SepGOCEin9Q,575.279,"of when you are losing your position"
SepGOCEin9Q,578.8,"and getting more and more controlled by"
SepGOCEin9Q,582.08,"your opponent"
SepGOCEin9Q,583.279,"you definitely want to know how to"
SepGOCEin9Q,586.0,"prevent"
SepGOCEin9Q,586.88,"things from getting worse and the number"
SepGOCEin9Q,588.64,"one step in order to do that is to be"
SepGOCEin9Q,590.399,"aware"
SepGOCEin9Q,591.839,"of what is actually worse um if you"
SepGOCEin9Q,594.64,"understand that"
SepGOCEin9Q,595.6,"then you are leaps and bounds um"
SepGOCEin9Q,598.88,"ahead of most beginners who aren't even"
SepGOCEin9Q,601.04,"aware that this type of sequential order"
SepGOCEin9Q,603.36,"exists"
SepGOCEin9Q,604.72,"and from there you can start working on"
SepGOCEin9Q,607.04,"escapes that way"
SepGOCEin9Q,608.32,"when you're on the bottom of side"
SepGOCEin9Q,609.6,"control which is where you're going to"
SepGOCEin9Q,611.2,"be for"
SepGOCEin9Q,612.0,"a majority of the time if you can learn"
SepGOCEin9Q,614.48,"how to"
SepGOCEin9Q,615.6,"escape the bottom of side control if you"
SepGOCEin9Q,617.839,"can prevent"
SepGOCEin9Q,618.64,"somebody getting neon belly if you can"
SepGOCEin9Q,620.8,"escape somebody having your back then"
SepGOCEin9Q,622.64,"you're going to be"
SepGOCEin9Q,624.079,"in such a great spot in your jujitsu"
SepGOCEin9Q,628.16,"because you're going to be able to move"
SepGOCEin9Q,630.0,"up and down this bjj tree and then from"
SepGOCEin9Q,633.12,"there you can actually"
SepGOCEin9Q,634.24,"work on submissions but if you can't"
SepGOCEin9Q,636.32,"escape"
SepGOCEin9Q,637.519,"negative positions then you're just"
SepGOCEin9Q,640.079,"going to be stuck underground and"
SepGOCEin9Q,641.279,"there's not"
SepGOCEin9Q,642.24,"very many submissions from like you"
SepGOCEin9Q,645.12,"don't even want to think about that you"
SepGOCEin9Q,646.32,"just want"
SepGOCEin9Q,647.12,"to positionally control your opponent"
SepGOCEin9Q,650.72,"um just like the name of the game"
SepGOCEin9Q,653.76,"so thank you very much for watching"
SepGOCEin9Q,656.24,"thank you very"
SepGOCEin9Q,660.32,"and until next time oh oh yeah one more"

SWttOYIMgH8,3.195,"— Hi everyone, you're watching Sasha and Katya"
SWttOYIMgH8,6.155,"— And our women self-defense project Free Fem Krav Maga"
SWttOYIMgH8,9.235,"*Women self-defense online course*"
SWttOYIMgH8,12.705,"Today we're going to speak about a threat"
SWttOYIMgH8,15.935,"that is really feared by many women."
SWttOYIMgH8,17.495,"While the main vital point of men is"
SWttOYIMgH8,20.485,"Groin!"
SWttOYIMgH8,21.565,"Women's vulnerable point is hair."
SWttOYIMgH8,23.895,"— Why so? It seams that hair is not an issue"
SWttOYIMgH8,26.415,"However there is a problem."
SWttOYIMgH8,29.645,"This is not about hurting a person,"
SWttOYIMgH8,32.605,"Still it's a side effect too... I know it because I had hair like that when I was younger"
SWttOYIMgH8,36.905,"It was appealing... Well."
SWttOYIMgH8,39.545,"Now I'm fond of effectiveness."
SWttOYIMgH8,41.405,"So currently I worry only about groin when it being kicked. But girls.."
SWttOYIMgH8,45.225,"When they got hair grabbed"
SWttOYIMgH8,47.955,"They feel really bad."
SWttOYIMgH8,51.035,"The grab will be performed"
SWttOYIMgH8,52.605,"by the left hand the most likely, but no there're no guarantees."
SWttOYIMgH8,57.105,"Look here"
SWttOYIMgH8,58.12,"I hold her well"
SWttOYIMgH8,66.56,"So.. do you like the view?"
SWttOYIMgH8,67.56,"— Well... yes..."
SWttOYIMgH8,74.02,"— No..."
SWttOYIMgH8,75.1,"— Why not?"
SWttOYIMgH8,77.2,"— Don't!"
SWttOYIMgH8,78.1,"— Why not?!"
SWttOYIMgH8,79.04,"— Just don't"
SWttOYIMgH8,79.98,"— Why so serious?"
SWttOYIMgH8,80.94,"Don't you want that, eh?"
SWttOYIMgH8,82.64,"— No."
SWttOYIMgH8,83.2,"— Then why did you come here with me?"
SWttOYIMgH8,85.16,"— Don't touch me!"
SWttOYIMgH8,85.78,"— Why shouldn't I?"
SWttOYIMgH8,95.84,"The best early reaction that we may find useful"
SWttOYIMgH8,99.52,"When you see a hand coming"
SWttOYIMgH8,101.86,"Is to block it and prevent it from grabbing. This is prevention, a tactical thing"
SWttOYIMgH8,106.22,"— Back off!"
SWttOYIMgH8,118.32,"I make a grabbing movement with my both hands"
SWttOYIMgH8,121.36,"Please notice that"
SWttOYIMgH8,123.7,"That our hand that is closest to attacker's grabbing hand"
SWttOYIMgH8,126.96,"Should be placed further, and the second hand will be closer to me."
SWttOYIMgH8,131.325,"Then our right hand"
SWttOYIMgH8,135.055,"the one that is further"
SWttOYIMgH8,137.165,"goes more or less to the point of elbow bending area."
SWttOYIMgH8,140.84,"My left hand"
SWttOYIMgH8,142.76,"Presses the attacker's hand to me."
SWttOYIMgH8,145.105,"I push on it somewhere around his wrist area"
SWttOYIMgH8,148.145,"In this technique we don't have to grab his hand."
SWttOYIMgH8,150.815,"My goal is to use our both forearms"
SWttOYIMgH8,153.325,"With all power I have to lean his arm to my body."
SWttOYIMgH8,156.205,"As firmly as I can,"
SWttOYIMgH8,157.86,"— In order to prevent it's movement and control it."
SWttOYIMgH8,163.32,"Currently I try to pull her"
SWttOYIMgH8,166.445,"With all my weight"
SWttOYIMgH8,169.645,"She's not pleased as you can see..."
SWttOYIMgH8,172.625,"— Holy crap, I'm not pleased at all!"
SWttOYIMgH8,175.46,"— That's right, but she controls the situation and my hand,"
SWttOYIMgH8,180.46,"*Checkpoint 1: Hand control*"
SWttOYIMgH8,184.84,"I bend here because in some cases"
SWttOYIMgH8,187.92,"I feel unpleasant pressure"
SWttOYIMgH8,190.415,"leverage on my elbow..."
SWttOYIMgH8,193.06,"or whatever"
SWttOYIMgH8,194.42,"I'm not sure how to name the place"
SWttOYIMgH8,196.34,"But I feel strong desire to go downwards."
SWttOYIMgH8,199.665,"— What should we do after that?"
SWttOYIMgH8,202.825,"We've got"
SWttOYIMgH8,205.825,"His arm that is fully controlled,"
SWttOYIMgH8,209.56,"Attacker that is bended a bit"
SWttOYIMgH8,213.78,"Then we perform our favourite attack,"
SWttOYIMgH8,215.945,"a knee strike. Which leg we gonna use?"

SWttOYIMgH8,233.825,"— Krav maga also pays attention to psychological training"
SWttOYIMgH8,237.855,"When you got hairgrabbed and dragged somewhere,"

SWttOYIMgH8,265.54,"— We'll show you."
SWttOYIMgH8,269.16,"— He's bended,"
SWttOYIMgH8,271.46,"he also released us. And we will hit him with hammers."
SWttOYIMgH8,275.58,"*Checkpoint 3: hammer punches*"
SWttOYIMgH8,278.22,"The last thing we should do is to make sure"
SWttOYIMgH8,281.28,"that he won't chase us. We also have to be sure"
SWttOYIMgH8,284.26,"we've got several seconds to turn away"
SWttOYIMgH8,287.6,"check the area"
SWttOYIMgH8,289.24,"find a way out"

SWttOYIMgH8,350.78,"Why it's important?"
SWttOYIMgH8,352.475,"Because hairgrab is a first step"
SWttOYIMgH8,355.365,"before choosing between several options"
SWttOYIMgH8,359.68,"There are 4 general scenarios a man may apply after hairgrab."
SWttOYIMgH8,365.1,"From less to more problematic ones."
SWttOYIMgH8,368.66,"The first one is almost nothing."
SWttOYIMgH8,371.98,"Domination and mental destruction."
SWttOYIMgH8,374.94,"The second option is a slap."
SWttOYIMgH8,378.5,"And some trash talking after."
SWttOYIMgH8,381.175,"The third is a knee strike,"
SWttOYIMgH8,384.545,"Light or heavy concussion"
SWttOYIMgH8,387.595,"in order to get advantage of semiconscious state"
SWttOYIMgH8,390.66,"of knockdown or knockout and do anything with you."
SWttOYIMgH8,393.48,"And the forth option is grab and drop to the ground."

tK3TzA6omu8,1081.039,"the end"
tK3TzA6omu8,1083.36,"portal the best way home would probably"
tK3TzA6omu8,1085.6,"be to put up a nether portal"

tK3TzA6omu8,1093.2,"another waypoint here"

tK3TzA6omu8,1098.56,"[Music]"
tK3TzA6omu8,1099.919,"actually i'm not too far away from home"
tK3TzA6omu8,1102.919,"212 blocks"
tK3TzA6omu8,1106.72,"of course it had to be through one of"
tK3TzA6omu8,1108.16,"these lovely biomes though pigs"
tK3TzA6omu8,1112.4,"i do not want to lose my 71 levels"
tK3TzA6omu8,1115.679,"so now"

tK3TzA6omu8,1128.559,"no it was quite simple yes yes i made"
tK3TzA6omu8,1131.84,"sure to eat properly now i haven't"
tK3TzA6omu8,1133.919,"brought you any presents the end is"
tK3TzA6omu8,1135.84,"literally like a desert it's super"
tK3TzA6omu8,1137.919,"boring there i am tired so demanding and"
tK3TzA6omu8,1141.2,"i guess one of the first things i have"
tK3TzA6omu8,1142.64,"to do is create one of these so that i"
tK3TzA6omu8,1145.36,"can access"
tK3TzA6omu8,1147.28,"yes some of the stuff that i brought"
tK3TzA6omu8,1149.039,"home and i'm not going to lie the"
tK3TzA6omu8,1150.48,"biggest find in these travels was not"
tK3TzA6omu8,1152.4,"the diamonds not the shulker shells not"
tK3TzA6omu8,1154.96,"the extra ender pearls not even the"
tK3TzA6omu8,1156.799,"diamond leggings it's probably these two"
tK3TzA6omu8,1158.88,"health potions you see the thing is"
tK3TzA6omu8,1161.12,"there's no natural health regeneration"
tK3TzA6omu8,1163.84,"inside a vault now later we'll be able"
tK3TzA6omu8,1165.919,"to get fancy gear that can give us life"
tK3TzA6omu8,1167.919,"leech and regeneration but right now we"
tK3TzA6omu8,1171.039,"have to relay rely rely yes i english"
tK3TzA6omu8,1174.88,"rely on health potions and remember how"
tK3TzA6omu8,1178.32,"i've kept going on about gold you see"
tK3TzA6omu8,1180.72,"the way you brew a health potion is"
tK3TzA6omu8,1183.039,"not with a glistering melon because that"
tK3TzA6omu8,1184.96,"would be way too easy and ridiculously"
tK3TzA6omu8,1187.2,"simple no you need a golden apple apple"
tK3TzA6omu8,1190.72,"gold however"
tK3TzA6omu8,1192.72,"this is not how you make a golden apple"
tK3TzA6omu8,1194.88,"in vault hunters this is how you make a"
tK3TzA6omu8,1197.76,"golden apple involved hunters and so far"
tK3TzA6omu8,1200.16,"i have managed to collect"
tK3TzA6omu8,1202.48,"a little over a stack of gold and even"
tK3TzA6omu8,1204.96,"though this is modded the technology of"
tK3TzA6omu8,1207.36,"ore doubling which is so common in every"
tK3TzA6omu8,1209.36,"modpack is not yet available to us long"
tK3TzA6omu8,1212.08,"story short health potions are extremely"
tK3TzA6omu8,1214.24,"valuable gold is extraordinarily"
tK3TzA6omu8,1216.799,"valuable and we're gonna need more of it"
tK3TzA6omu8,1218.96,"but before we get ahead of ourselves"
tK3TzA6omu8,1221.12,"it's time we craft up the vault altar"
tK3TzA6omu8,1224.0,"and luckily those two diamonds that i"
tK3TzA6omu8,1225.84,"picked up actually made it so that i"
tK3TzA6omu8,1227.36,"have exactly nine this is a huge moment"
tK3TzA6omu8,1230.159,"because this is where"
tK3TzA6omu8,1231.76,"it all begins"
tK3TzA6omu8,1233.2,"you"
tK3TzA6omu8,1234.4,"you"
tK3TzA6omu8,1235.28,"you and obsidian"
tK3TzA6omu8,1238.159,"there it is"
tK3TzA6omu8,1239.6,"there it is it's beautiful i shall place"
tK3TzA6omu8,1242.96,"it down here huh"
tK3TzA6omu8,1245.36,"huh well"
tK3TzA6omu8,1247.44,"it doesn't actually do anything on its"
tK3TzA6omu8,1249.44,"own see we need to put a rock in the"
tK3TzA6omu8,1251.84,"middle and infuse that rock with items"
tK3TzA6omu8,1255.12,"and then we get a vault crystal"
tK3TzA6omu8,1258.24,"aha"
tK3TzA6omu8,1260.32,"no"
tK3TzA6omu8,1262.96,"no no it's not it's not that simple we"
tK3TzA6omu8,1265.28,"need something called a vault rock this"
tK3TzA6omu8,1268.64,"thing and voltrox can be mined deep down"
tK3TzA6omu8,1272.0,"below why level 5 to 11 to be exact oh"
tK3TzA6omu8,1276.32,"and they are rarer than diamonds the"
tK3TzA6omu8,1278.24,"good thing is though fortune works time"
tK3TzA6omu8,1281.52,"to get digging and i forgot torches"
tK3TzA6omu8,1285.76,"and i'm out of wood"
tK3TzA6omu8,1290.88,"all set"
tK3TzA6omu8,1298.32,"this is certainly where an extra level"
tK3TzA6omu8,1299.919,"in vain miner would have been very"
tK3TzA6omu8,1301.6,"beneficial"
tK3TzA6omu8,1305.919,"yes there it is the texture is quite"
tK3TzA6omu8,1309.36,"hidden and not always super easy to spot"
tK3TzA6omu8,1312.559,"there is one trick however"
tK3TzA6omu8,1315.2,"they do glow ever so slightly"
tK3TzA6omu8,1318.4,"so if you don't light an area up you can"
tK3TzA6omu8,1320.24,"spot them that way anyway"
tK3TzA6omu8,1322.48,"let's hope for"
tK3TzA6omu8,1323.919,"at least two"
tK3TzA6omu8,1326.0,"yes"
tK3TzA6omu8,1326.88,"three oh wait a minute"
tK3TzA6omu8,1329.52,"aha"
tK3TzA6omu8,1330.88,"i spotted it from the glowiness"
tK3TzA6omu8,1333.52,"oh just one that's all i need for now"
tK3TzA6omu8,1335.84,"though because every one of these"
tK3TzA6omu8,1338.24,"is an access key"
tK3TzA6omu8,1340.559,"to the vault put some more gold on the"
tK3TzA6omu8,1342.64,"fire compress my redstone down compress"
tK3TzA6omu8,1345.679,"my cobblestone down yes that's totally a"
tK3TzA6omu8,1348.4,"thing compressed cobblestone and granite"
tK3TzA6omu8,1351.2,"gravel underside"
tK3TzA6omu8,1353.36,"bird poop etc etc this is a huge moment"
tK3TzA6omu8,1358.0,"and for those of you who've never seen"
tK3TzA6omu8,1359.76,"walt hunters before this is where it all"
tK3TzA6omu8,1362.72,"begins funny story in my last episode i"
tK3TzA6omu8,1365.44,"got a few comments saying that the easy"
tK3TzA6omu8,1367.679,"villager mod and the twerking"
tK3TzA6omu8,1370.159,"was"
tK3TzA6omu8,1371.039,"almost as if i was cheating as in it"
tK3TzA6omu8,1373.679,"made the game way too easy and i may"
tK3TzA6omu8,1376.4,"just as well playing creative i got news"
tK3TzA6omu8,1378.4,"for you getting a bit of wheat and"
tK3TzA6omu8,1380.799,"picking up villagers"
tK3TzA6omu8,1382.48,"is not the goal of the game you see when"
tK3TzA6omu8,1384.159,"i put my voltrok down on the altar we"
tK3TzA6omu8,1386.48,"will be presented with a random recipe"
tK3TzA6omu8,1389.76,"four different items that it needs in"
tK3TzA6omu8,1393.039,"order to become a vault crystal and as i"
tK3TzA6omu8,1395.84,"said the crystal is what you use to get"
tK3TzA6omu8,1397.679,"into the vaults now the thing is this"
tK3TzA6omu8,1400.08,"recipe is random every time you get"
tK3TzA6omu8,1402.08,"different things and the more crystals"
tK3TzA6omu8,1404.559,"you craft"
tK3TzA6omu8,1405.76,"the harder the recipe becomes and we"
tK3TzA6omu8,1408.4,"could get extremely unlucky and get"
tK3TzA6omu8,1410.0,"something extremely difficult here or we"
tK3TzA6omu8,1411.84,"could get super lucky and get something"
tK3TzA6omu8,1413.84,"very simple there's only one way to find"
tK3TzA6omu8,1415.76,"out"
tK3TzA6omu8,1417.2,"here goes"
tK3TzA6omu8,1421.84,"first of all we actually got a lucky"
tK3TzA6omu8,1424.4,"alter that means that it requires less"
tK3TzA6omu8,1426.48,"resources than ordinary and that's why"
tK3TzA6omu8,1428.559,"we got the green ding not too bad"
tK3TzA6omu8,1432.559,"even though turtle eggs is a little bit"
tK3TzA6omu8,1434.96,"of a pain as we progress through this"
tK3TzA6omu8,1437.039,"mod pack we're gonna see things like"
tK3TzA6omu8,1440.0,"15 000 ink sacks a hundred thousand dirt"
tK3TzA6omu8,1444.08,"7636"
tK3TzA6omu8,1446.64,"redstone to be precise this corner"
tK3TzA6omu8,1449.12,"however will always contain a rare item"
tK3TzA6omu8,1452.08,"and the idea of walt hunters is to"
tK3TzA6omu8,1453.6,"enable you to build mega farms to handle"
tK3TzA6omu8,1456.96,"all of the resources that you need to"
tK3TzA6omu8,1458.72,"make your crystals and if you're ever"
tK3TzA6omu8,1460.64,"confused with what these items are you"
tK3TzA6omu8,1462.4,"can always shift and it will tell you"
tK3TzA6omu8,1464.24,"ink sac redstone dust third leg and dirt"
tK3TzA6omu8,1466.799,"now in order to complete the recipe all"
tK3TzA6omu8,1468.4,"we have to do is grab the resources it"
tK3TzA6omu8,1470.88,"asks for currently i only have dirt and"
tK3TzA6omu8,1473.44,"redstone out of those resources and"
tK3TzA6omu8,1475.44,"simply throw them in you can also do"
tK3TzA6omu8,1477.919,"this through a hopper"
tK3TzA6omu8,1479.6,"or later an exporter from mods and there"
tK3TzA6omu8,1482.08,"it is a half completed vault crystal"
tK3TzA6omu8,1485.36,"let's get the ink sack"
tK3TzA6omu8,1487.0,"squid hello"
tK3TzA6omu8,1490.48,"hello"
tK3TzA6omu8,1492.159,"did he spawn"
tK3TzA6omu8,1493.6,"i think it is behind it he spawned when"
tK3TzA6omu8,1496.08,"i dashed"
tK3TzA6omu8,1498.24,"hello there"
tK3TzA6omu8,1500.64,"and"
tK3TzA6omu8,1502.559,"aha i just realized something in order"
tK3TzA6omu8,1505.12,"to get the turtle egg i'm pretty sure i"
tK3TzA6omu8,1506.64,"need a silk touch pickaxe is this your"
tK3TzA6omu8,1509.2,"way of punishing me for not selecting"
tK3TzA6omu8,1511.2,"the silk touch trade dear villagers well"
tK3TzA6omu8,1514.08,"i guess there's only one thing to do hmm"
tK3TzA6omu8,1516.32,"we seem to have a little bit of an issue"
tK3TzA6omu8,1517.919,"with space good sirs i guess we'll have"
tK3TzA6omu8,1520.24,"to try and make do with what we have"
tK3TzA6omu8,1526.32,"it's brilliant hello there please be"
tK3TzA6omu8,1529.44,"nice"
tK3TzA6omu8,1532.39,"[Applause]"
tK3TzA6omu8,1533.84,"hmm"
tK3TzA6omu8,1534.799,"i guess we'll take it this pickaxe will"
tK3TzA6omu8,1537.44,"literally just have silk touch"
tK3TzA6omu8,1540.48,"as a statement"
tK3TzA6omu8,1542.4,"i guess since i need to find a beach i"
tK3TzA6omu8,1544.72,"should probably enchant my elijah with"
tK3TzA6omu8,1547.039,"mending and i'm breaking his cows"
tK3TzA6omu8,1550.08,"wings"
tK3TzA6omu8,1552.4,"now i may not have rockets but i have"
tK3TzA6omu8,1555.44,"dash"
tK3TzA6omu8,1556.48,"although the cooldown as in the time in"
tK3TzA6omu8,1559.44,"between i can spend it again or use it"
tK3TzA6omu8,1561.36,"again is quite high at the moment but it"
tK3TzA6omu8,1563.919,"should be enough"
tK3TzA6omu8,1565.6,"to use my life properly nice"
tK3TzA6omu8,1569.32,"turtles"
tK3TzA6omu8,1570.88,"hmm"
tK3TzA6omu8,1572.48,"ooh shipwreck hmm"
tK3TzA6omu8,1574.799,"did you know that there's a trick to"
tK3TzA6omu8,1576.48,"treasure hunting i don't really know"
tK3TzA6omu8,1578.64,"what the trick is but there is a trick"
tK3TzA6omu8,1580.24,"to it i think it has to do with the"
tK3TzA6omu8,1582.0,"center of the chunk"
tK3TzA6omu8,1583.84,"yeah nice"
tK3TzA6omu8,1586.0,"oh this is actually great part of the"
tK3TzA6omu8,1588.4,"sea is one of the items that can appear"
tK3TzA6omu8,1590.159,"in the vault altar so we definitely need"
tK3TzA6omu8,1591.84,"to hoard that anyway back to hunting"
tK3TzA6omu8,1594.159,"turtles this area up here looks quite"
tK3TzA6omu8,1596.64,"promising it is a bit of a travel"
tK3TzA6omu8,1599.52,"turtles"
tK3TzA6omu8,1601.679,"it looked better on the map oh this"
tK3TzA6omu8,1604.08,"island looks promising"
tK3TzA6omu8,1607.52,"where am i oh yes hello right i gotta"
tK3TzA6omu8,1610.559,"remember how to do this this stuff and"
tK3TzA6omu8,1613.52,"you and you"

tK3TzA6omu8,1618.12,"[Laughter]"
tK3TzA6omu8,1620.48,"i wonder how they decide who gets to dig"

tqaVPn4YFaY,264.4,"and not ignoring them night vision and"
tqaVPn4YFaY,266.639,"things like this but do you actually use"
tqaVPn4YFaY,268.4,"them are they buried in some menu"

tqaVPn4YFaY,992.88,"in the screen here and everything is"
tqaVPn4YFaY,994.32,"oriented towards this screen and that's"
tqaVPn4YFaY,996.399,"one of the benefits of having this"

tqaVPn4YFaY,1000.959,"there's no obstruction here now one of"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1003.279,"my favorite things about this car in"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1004.959,"autopilot driving is how easy it is to"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1007.44,"jump in and out of it"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1008.959,"like your settings are all set up in"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1010.399,"advance in the menu system but then if"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1012.24,"you want to toggle it on you just click"

tqaVPn4YFaY,1018.8,"up i just push this wheel forward if i"

tqaVPn4YFaY,1026.16,"just like"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1027.12,"any type of adaptive cruise control"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1028.88,"where"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1029.919,"it'll keep the same distance between you"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1031.76,"and the car in front if you want to"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1033.679,"switch lanes then you just simply use"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1036.72,"your signal indicator and"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1039.039,"the car will look for an opportunity to"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1041.28,"change lanes"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1042.48,"you can also be"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1044.24,"have a little bit more agency over it"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1045.679,"like let this car pass and then say i"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1047.6,"want to switch lanes it looks for a spot"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1049.679,"can't do it yet then it goes"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1052.72,"on its own mo got a kick out of that"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1054.72,"it's constantly improving"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1056.799,"it's uh constantly getting fine-tuned"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1058.96,"and"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1059.6,"this is one of the smoothest experiences"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1061.679,"that i've had you will have to touch the"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1063.36,"steering wheel every so often it says"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1065.12,"please keep your hands on the yoke be"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1066.96,"prepared to take over at any time so i"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1069.12,"can kind of have them like this i could"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1070.4,"pick up a coffee drink a coffee i'm"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1072.24,"monitoring what's going on so apply"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1074.4,"slight turning force to the steering"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1076.08,"yoke it also flashes"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1078.48,"white at the top so i barely touched it"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1080.559,"and that's enough"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1081.84,"to re-engage and let the system know"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1084.24,"that i'm here i'm gonna turn on"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1085.84,"autonomous here"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1088.0,"so if you're approaching a light"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1089.84,"that is currently green"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1091.76,"but changing"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1093.52,"to yellow or red"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1095.52,"then you would not hit the accelerator"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1097.679,"to continue but if it maintains its"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1099.44,"green you tap the accelerator and you"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1101.6,"proceed"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1102.64,"through"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1103.76,"the intersection look at the way see it"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1105.919,"knows it knows for example that that's a"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1107.6,"giant bus it knows that that's a large"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1109.919,"truck now we're still in autopilot and"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1111.679,"look the car"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1112.88,"takes off on its own"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1114.799,"it's going to still stop for the traffic"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1117.2,"light unless i use the accelerator i"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1119.52,"touch the accelerator just tap it"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1121.76,"to continue"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1123.12,"and it goes"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1124.88,"through the green line and then through"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1127.2,"the lights which it sees over here"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1131.28,"and then i can go ahead and increase the"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1133.52,"speed now one of the nice things about"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1135.36,"the yolk is if you use autopilot a lot"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1138.08,"it's uh kind of a comfortable place to"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1140.16,"rest your finger or hand here anyways"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1142.96,"it's actually a pretty sophisticated"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1144.559,"system now maybe i am slightly more"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1147.84,"impressed because i haven't had"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1150.08,"experiences with the previous system so"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1151.84,"it wasn't like i got to know it"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1154.32,"intimately"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1155.44,"let me just say one more thing on the"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1156.96,"autopilot front because it's really"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1158.48,"weird"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1159.679,"there's"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1161.52,"this experience you have owning a"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1163.679,"vehicle like this which is a high"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1164.96,"performance vehicle"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1166.559,"obviously very quick"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1168.4,"uh"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1169.28,"plaid"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1170.799,"zero to 62 seconds whatever whatever it"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1172.88,"happens to be"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1174.24,"sometimes you want to drive like that"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1175.76,"sometimes"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1177.12,"you you want to performance the"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1178.64,"snappiness"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1180.48,"other times you want to hit the button"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1182.48,"and let the car do it on its own it's"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1184.559,"actually the best of both worlds it's"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1186.08,"not one or the other"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1187.679,"which was a concern of mine i was"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1189.28,"thinking okay this in this autonomous"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1192.0,"future what happens to the joy of"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1194.48,"driving and i think it's why this"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1195.84,"vehicle is so critical because"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1198.24,"i mean the joy is still there i i"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1200.4,"realize some people want to have a"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1201.919,"certain sound they want to have a"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1204.159,"certain feel a more mechanical feel"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1206.72,"possibly but the exhilaration is there"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1209.6,"if if you drive this thing quickly"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1212.4,"uh"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1213.84,"you're gonna feel it"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1216.24,"in your body"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1219.36,"no"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1221.84,"he's still trying no please"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1227.12,"okay okay that's good"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1229.679,"oh my god"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1231.84,"oh my god"
tqaVPn4YFaY,1236.92,"[Laughter]"

Ug1zBu4jaKE,105.75,"right right between the knees right here"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,107.549,"alright so right here Haeju is gonna"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,109.5,"turn and make a frame all right she can"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,112.38,"get on her side just a little bit okay"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,114.299,"now on this side that she's going to"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,116.189,"she's gonna kick this left leg straight"

Ug1zBu4jaKE,127.86,"all right I mean it's kind of"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,129.869,"simplifying it but still the idea she"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,132.57,"just the easiest way to make this work"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,134.34,"is if she could step over once she steps"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,136.59,"over she can kind of drag this like"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,137.88,"backwards and now I'm like my leg is"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,140.85,"very light"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,141.63,"all right she's already got a portion my"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,143.49,"foot passed through her guard now she"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,146.49,"can bring her knee or elbow together on"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,148.62,"the same side this is why she kicked"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,150.09,"that left leg straight all right with a"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,153.18,"knee pass through the guard right now"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,154.59,"she could turn her frame double frame"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,157.38,"against the arms I can't make a I can't"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,159.3,"cross her down the cross face she's"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,160.95,"going to hip escape out she got trapped"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,163.05,"this leg she's gonna swing that leg"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,165.24,"around the closed door right here"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,180.3,"she's my instant mat but she can't"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,183.03,"control him she can't make enough space"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,184.32,"okay so she's gonna work through a"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,186.6,"series of smaller movements now she's he"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,188.61,"going to turn to her side and make a"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,189.84,"double frame against my head - so stop"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,191.67,"me from signed up she kicks it's like"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,193.59,"straight cause it's not like she's gonna"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,194.79,"slide underneath now I just got step"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,196.92,"over dragging his leg through"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,199.14,"all right knee clears now it's just a"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,202.08,"term with a double frame cuz I'm I watch"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,203.73,"our veins position again she blocks all"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,206.82,"right she HIPPA skips out chops my leg"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,210.12,"brings the leg through for closed guard"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,213.23,"one left this way that way just sends"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,217.23,"last little grain angles"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,238.97,"the only difference realistically is if"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,242.15,"she could step over leg of mine you can"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,245.159,"still do this technique and you have to"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,246.69,"be able to do this technique if you"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,248.19,"can't step over all actually demonstrate"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,250.079,"this time so from right here"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,256.019,"major hunt I mean just in this example"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,258.06,"she's much smaller me and maybe I'm in"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,260.16,"my flexibility in her positions and I"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,262.74,"can't step over and capture this foot"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,264.449,"nice to office treatments like I saw big"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,266.96,"mistake that see sometimes if you learn"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,269.16,"this as they take this leg needs to stay"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,271.139,"up well you're not a magician and your"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,273.69,"legs not gonna disappear through her Oh"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,275.25,"Mike you have to go underneath so you"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,277.71,"gotta make this elbow Sphinx right here"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,279.27,"sign that neat and the elbow together"
Ug1zBu4jaKE,281.3,"right like that now walking your feet in"

v56R17Q_XYY,184.879,"second"
v56R17Q_XYY,185.76,"and you got the ball to the official"
v56R17Q_XYY,187.519,"perfectly if it was perfect you'd have"
v56R17Q_XYY,190.319,"probably two seconds left"
v56R17Q_XYY,193.2,"really"
v56R17Q_XYY,194.56,"you're gonna make it that close if it's"
v56R17Q_XYY,196.8,"perfect at practice"
v56R17Q_XYY,199.04,"you'd have two seconds left"
v56R17Q_XYY,202.239,"you know it's not practice it's the"

v56R17Q_XYY,205.519,"you"
v56R17Q_XYY,206.239,"you run a sideline pattern"

v56R17Q_XYY,213.68,"sideline pattern"
v56R17Q_XYY,216.239,"in the end"
v56R17Q_XYY,217.84,"i hated this call and i don't care what"

v56R17Q_XYY,229.04,"they're going to play"
v56R17Q_XYY,230.799,"but on a bigger picture let's talk about"
v56R17Q_XYY,232.64,"this let me ask you a question because i"
v56R17Q_XYY,233.92,"know cowboy fans this morning they trail"
v56R17Q_XYY,235.68,"the entire game want to blame everybody"
v56R17Q_XYY,238.56,"do the cowboys look like a well-coached"
v56R17Q_XYY,240.239,"team"
v56R17Q_XYY,241.439,"does deck look like a great quarterback"
v56R17Q_XYY,243.519,"because i saw a great quarterbacks this"

v56R17Q_XYY,248.08,"great"
v56R17Q_XYY,249.92,"dak looked much closer to jimmy"
v56R17Q_XYY,251.36,"garoppolo than joe burrow"
v56R17Q_XYY,253.68,"or patrick holmes"
v56R17Q_XYY,255.2,"and do you feel you're a and you're and"
v56R17Q_XYY,257.12,"dax your guy now"
v56R17Q_XYY,259.12,"but mike mccarthy didn't have to be your"
v56R17Q_XYY,261.12,"guy"
v56R17Q_XYY,261.919,"but i don't have a lot of sympathy for"
v56R17Q_XYY,263.28,"the dallas cowboys if you keep doing the"
v56R17Q_XYY,264.88,"same stuff over and over and over gonna"
v56R17Q_XYY,266.32,"run that thing back so aaron rodgers is"
v56R17Q_XYY,268.56,"a great quarterback he also appears to"
v56R17Q_XYY,270.24,"have a great coach"
v56R17Q_XYY,271.759,"patrick hall is a great quarterback he"
v56R17Q_XYY,273.52,"appears to have a great coach and tom"
v56R17Q_XYY,274.96,"brady's a great quarterback and we know"
v56R17Q_XYY,277.28,"at least aryans is a really really"
v56R17Q_XYY,278.88,"really good coach and josh allen's a"
v56R17Q_XYY,281.199,"great quarterback and he appears to have"
v56R17Q_XYY,282.96,"a tremendous young coach"
v56R17Q_XYY,284.88,"dax a solid quarterback sometimes he's"
v56R17Q_XYY,287.52,"pretty good and he's got a weak coach so"
v56R17Q_XYY,290.32,"you can't change dak you can't run him"
v56R17Q_XYY,292.24,"out of town"
v56R17Q_XYY,294.4,"where do you make the change"
v56R17Q_XYY,296.56,"dak is not talented enough to overcome a"
v56R17Q_XYY,300.32,"really average coach don't you think"
v56R17Q_XYY,302.479,"it's kind of strange that since mike"
v56R17Q_XYY,304.0,"mccarthy left aaron rodgers is going to"
v56R17Q_XYY,306.4,"win back-to-back mvps"
v56R17Q_XYY,308.639,"have you noticed since mike mccarthy"
v56R17Q_XYY,310.8,"left we say this about aaron rodgers all"
v56R17Q_XYY,312.8,"the time"
v56R17Q_XYY,313.68,"guy makes it look so easy"
v56R17Q_XYY,316.0,"it never looked that easy with mccarthy"
v56R17Q_XYY,317.759,"it looks easy with matt lafleur"
v56R17Q_XYY,319.919,"but i'm watching all these other teams"
v56R17Q_XYY,321.759,"and so is jerry jones in kansas city and"
v56R17Q_XYY,323.759,"buffalo and tampa and green bay those"
v56R17Q_XYY,326.479,"are great quarterbacks that have great"
v56R17Q_XYY,328.8,"support systems from their coaching"
v56R17Q_XYY,330.16,"staff"
v56R17Q_XYY,331.12,"i don't put dak in that class"
v56R17Q_XYY,333.84,"and mccarthy's not even remotely close"
v56R17Q_XYY,335.919,"to that class at least dak has days"
v56R17Q_XYY,338.8,"games sundays i mean he did score over"
v56R17Q_XYY,340.8,"50. scored over 43 times over 30"

v56R17Q_XYY,356.319,"does"
v56R17Q_XYY,358.16,"but i mean this is what we said"
v56R17Q_XYY,361.36,"dallas was going to beat up on the"
v56R17Q_XYY,362.96,"flimsy nfc east but when they played"
v56R17Q_XYY,365.36,"arizona at home they lost in vegas they"
v56R17Q_XYY,367.68,"lost them san francisco they lost in"

v56R17Q_XYY,383.36,"i would put mike mccarthy in an advisory"
v56R17Q_XYY,385.919,"role i don't want to ruin people's lives"
v56R17Q_XYY,388.479,"you have to strongly though consider"
v56R17Q_XYY,390.8,"today dan quinn or kellen moore's the"
v56R17Q_XYY,392.72,"coach you've gotta strongly consider it"
v56R17Q_XYY,396.16,"i mean how many examples do i need"
v56R17Q_XYY,400.0,"folks"
v56R17Q_XYY,401.199,"did you see the sideline for the cowboys"
v56R17Q_XYY,403.84,"during the fake punt they pulled off"
v56R17Q_XYY,406.88,"here's video for our tv audience this is"
v56R17Q_XYY,409.599,"a fake punt even when they succeeded"
v56R17Q_XYY,412.72,"look at the sidelines it's chaos they"
v56R17Q_XYY,415.759,"were trying to induce a delay of game"
v56R17Q_XYY,418.8,"they did"
v56R17Q_XYY,420.16,"on"
v56R17Q_XYY,420.84,"themselves even when they succeed"

v56R17Q_XYY,427.44,"succeed on the final drive of the game"
v56R17Q_XYY,430.479,"in the end it looks like a disorganized"
v56R17Q_XYY,433.039,"mess"
v56R17Q_XYY,434.16,"the cowboys with the most penalized team"
v56R17Q_XYY,436.4,"in the nfl in the regular season the"

v56R17Q_XYY,447.039,"head coach for a decade plus"
v56R17Q_XYY,450.479,"it'd be one thing if you had a rookie"

v56R17Q_XYY,454.4,"nick ceriani's got a young quarterback"

WH_ugKNCKlQ,297.04,"cool narrative connection between all"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,298.8,"these games but a lot of people were"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,300.24,"quick to point out that there's dialogue"

WH_ugKNCKlQ,303.28,"final release where freddy says that"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,305.12,"gregory is bleeding specifically he says"

WH_ugKNCKlQ,313.919,"gregory's an animatronic and uh i"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,315.919,"actually have two things to say about"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,317.6,"that first when i've used cut lines of"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,319.919,"dialogue in the past the internet has in"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,321.759,"no uncertain terms told me that i can't"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,323.919,"but uh now apparently it's okay kinda"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,326.16,"inconsistent there guys and honestly i"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,327.759,"think cutting it regardless of the"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,329.52,"reason shows that it didn't fit the"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,330.8,"final creative intent of the game but"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,332.4,"anyway if that's the case then i gotta"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,334.0,"bring this line up a cut line of"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,335.68,"dialogue discovered by gb aura recharged"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,338.4,"in the game files this one is freddy"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,340.479,"saying gregory i know why you're not in"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,342.639,"the customer database i remember you"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,344.8,"from the and it cuts off obviously it's"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,347.28,"vague it's kept very intentionally vague"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,349.68,"but it also shows that gregory is"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,351.52,"special in a way that the other"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,353.039,"disappeared kids aren't there's a reason"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,355.52,"he's not in the customer base he's from"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,357.84,"somewhere specific that freddy knows"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,360.0,"about if i were to guess i'd say like"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,361.6,"the underground pizzeria but you know"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,363.68,"that's just me hypothesizing adding to"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,365.6,"the gregory is special idea is the fact"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,367.759,"that chica knows his name she calls it"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,370.56,"out in the middle of the pizzeria"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,374.4,"strange detail for a kid who supposedly"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,376.72,"has no records in the system secondly"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,379.039,"and i uh i hate to be the bearer of bad"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,381.039,"news here but in the books because"

WH_ugKNCKlQ,389.52,"heck they can even feel hungry and eat"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,391.68,"and you don't even have to go to the"

WH_ugKNCKlQ,401.44,"franchise that we're talking about here"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,403.199,"and for everyone who is confused about"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,404.4,"the timeline of crying child still being"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,406.319,"alive and the fact that he would be"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,407.6,"older at this point that wouldn't"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,409.039,"actually be the case animatronic"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,410.4,"children in the books stay at whatever"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,412.319,"age they're built to be charlotte emily"

WH_ugKNCKlQ,416.4,"herself built one for each stage of her"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,418.639,"life so that way she could grow older"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,420.56,"but she would just assume a new"

WH_ugKNCKlQ,424.24,"child still being young would actually"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,425.68,"make more sense here and everyone's"

WH_ugKNCKlQ,519.039,"does gregory's vision glitch when he"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,520.88,"sees vani why does he have such a weird"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,523.12,"visual reaction to her and to literally"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,525.519,"no other character in the game well you"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,528.48,"hear that high-pitched ringing sound as"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,530.16,"vanie skips and gets closer"

WH_ugKNCKlQ,557.519,"i'm already fighting a losing battle"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,559.12,"over here so i'm just gonna gloss over"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,560.72,"that one anyway to me it reads as"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,562.72,"gregory's robotic eyes being disrupted i"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,564.88,"mean why have crt lines over the screen"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,567.6,"and not some other type of filter to"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,569.279,"show that his vision is getting"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,570.56,"disrupted in fact why have the same crt"

WH_ugKNCKlQ,576.16,"the pizza plex but there's one final"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,577.68,"piece of evidence i'd like to talk about"

WH_ugKNCKlQ,580.8,"before we move on and that is the"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,582.64,"screenshot here of the final scene from"

WH_ugKNCKlQ,594.399,"they're just labeled as s1 s2 and s3"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,596.959,"based on the number of stars that you"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,598.399,"get for them it is worth noting though"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,600.24,"that this is the only three star ending"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,603.2,"that currently exists which seems to"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,605.12,"imply that it has some level of"

WH_ugKNCKlQ,610.16,"vanessa all sitting on a hill which as i"
WH_ugKNCKlQ,612.16,"pointed out last time is very similar to"

Wsd6WoKWW2g,186.14,"But there was just one"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,problem with this vision.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,188.6,"Most blood tests could not be done"

Wsd6WoKWW2g,371.58,"while continuing to market"

Wsd6WoKWW2g,375.74,"During the trial of Elizabeth Holmes,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,377.26,"prosecutors showed a presentation"

Wsd6WoKWW2g,board of directors saying,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,380.35,"that 10 of the 15 largest"

Wsd6WoKWW2g,417.96,"who knew her technology didn't work."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,419.84,"They said she was obsessed"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,with fame and fortune,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,422.01,"and prosecutors presented evidence"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,423.66,"that when Theranos"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,realized its test results,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,425.51,"were not accurate, the"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,company substituted tests,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,427.94,"from regular blood draws, making it look"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,429.74,"as if the tests were"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,from blood droplet tests,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,431.96,"rather than traditional blood draws"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,433.49,"and conventional machines."

Wsd6WoKWW2g,435.89,"that Holmes exaggerated"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,the company's involvement,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,438.07,"with potential partners."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,439.61,"Prosecutors demonstrated that Holmes lied"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,441.5,"about having deals with drug companies"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,443.09,"like Pfizer and the US military."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,444.76,"Holmes even added the logos of Pfizer"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,446.5,"and Schering-Plough to lab reports"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,447.99,"that she used in her"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,presentation to investors,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,450.21,"and Walgreens executives."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,451.99,"But these companies"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,hadn't actually validated,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,453.67,"any of Theranos' systems."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,455.47,"But the defense put on a case as well."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,457.88,"Holmes testified for seven days,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,459.77,"presenting herself as a visionary woman"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,461.98,"in a male-dominated field."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,463.53,"Holmes told the jury"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,that she still believed,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,465.7,"that Theranos was on the verge of proving"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,467.82,"its technology worked."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,469.18,"She blamed her ex-partner, Sunny Balwani,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,471.27,"for misleading regulators about the tests."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,473.33,"Holmes told the jury that the two had"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,475.15,"secretly lived together,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,476.12,"and that Balwani abused her"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,throughout the relationship,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,479.23,"and Balwani himself will go"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,on trial later this year.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,481.96,"And Holmes attempted to"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,raise a good faith defense,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,484.1,"to the wire fraud charges."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,486.15,"Although good faith is"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,a defense to wire fraud,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,488.1,"an honest belief in the ultimate success"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,490.14,"of the enterprise is"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,not in itself a defense,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,492.61,"and the judge instructed the"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,jury that if they believe,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,494.64,"that she acted in good faith"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,in her representations,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,497.19,"then she could not also have acted"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,498.84,"with an intent to defraud."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,500.03,"So let's dig into the"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,elements of wire fraud,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,502.19,"and the conspiracy charges that she faced."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,505.23,"Holmes was eventually"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,convicted of three counts,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,507.23,"of wire fraud and conspiracy"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,to commit wire fraud.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,509.82,"18 USC 1343 is the wire fraud statute."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,512.63,"It states, "Whoever, having"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,devised, or intending to devise,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,515.217,""any scheme, or artifice to defraud,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,517.037,""or for obtaining money, or"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,property by means of false,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,520.157,""or fraudulent pretenses,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,representations, or promises,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,523.517,""transmits, or causes to be"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,transmitted by means of wire,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,526.497,""radio, or television"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,communication in interstate,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,528.897,""or foreign commerce, any"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,writings, signs, signals,",""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,531.91,"yada, yada, "shall be"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,fined under this title,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,534.357,""or imprisoned not more"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,than 20 years, or both.",""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,537.13,"So the prosecution had"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,to prove four elements,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,539.49,"first, that she knowingly participated"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,541.35,"in some sort of scheme to"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,defraud and obtain money,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,545.08,"or property from other people."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,547.62,"Expressions of opinions,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,aspirations, or goals,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,550.19,"or general subjective claims"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,can't be used as a basis,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,552.63,"to find that someone made a false,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,554.26,"or fraudulent representation."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,555.94,"This is an important point,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,557.03,"and one we'll come back to when we talk"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,558.61,"about the jury's conclusion"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,559.45,"that she didn't defraud consumers,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,561.61,"probably because some jurors"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,said that she believed,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,564.02,"that she had positive goals."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,565.65,"But the second prong is"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,that the statements made,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,567.61,"as part of the scheme have to be material."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,569.53,"Statements tend to be material"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,570.92,"if they have a natural"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,tendency to influence,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,573.17,"or are capable of influencing a person"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,574.83,"to part with their money."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,576.35,"The third prong is that the"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,government needed to show,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,578.09,"that Holmes acted with"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,the intent to defraud,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,580.03,"that is that she had"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,the intent to deceive,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,582.22,"and cheat someone out of"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,their money, or property.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,584.45,"And then the fourth"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,prong is that Holmes used,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,586.54,"interstate wire communication to carry out"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,588.52,"an essential part of the scheme."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,589.78,"And the jury found that"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,Holmes' misrepresentations,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,592.3,"influenced investors to"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,send money to Theranos,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,594.55,"and that her presentations"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,actively intended,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,597.07,"to defraud investors"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,by making them believe,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,599.1,"that Theranos had big government contracts"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,602.21,"and private partnerships"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,that would produce,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,604.17,"a high rate of return on their investment."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,606.44,"And the jury also found"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,that Holmes had agreed,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,608.55,"with other people to perpetrate"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,this scheme on others.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,611.16,"That's why she was convicted"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,612.15,"of a conspiracy to commit"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,wire fraud as well.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,615.05,"The prosecution had lots of evidence"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,616.5,"that Holmes concocted test"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,results to convince investors,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,618.99,"that the science behind"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,her test was sound.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,621.15,"In a 2014 "Forbes" article,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,Holmes said that Theranos,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,624.06,"quote, "Does not buy any"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,analyzers from third parties,",""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,627.07,"and that was absolutely a lie."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,629.29,"Theranos presented results conducted"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,630.8,"on these third-party analyzers"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,632.19,"during their presentations to investors,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,633.92,"and it's highly likely"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,that the jury thought,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,635.59,"that these lies were material,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,636.81,"and that they convinced investors"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,to part with their money.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,639.4,"And the three counts represented a total"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,641.0,"of about $142 million in fraud."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,643.6,"But the jury deadlocked"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,on three additional,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,645.38,"wire fraud counts related to investments"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,647.47,"from three Theranos"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,investors, Alan Eisenman,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,650.0,"Chris Lucas of Black Diamond Ventures,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,651.58,"and Bryan Tolbert of the Hall Group."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,653.76,"Prosecutors now have to decide"

Wsd6WoKWW2g,the jury ranked witnesses,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,736.49,"according to their believability,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,737.99,"and that they rated Mattis as the witness"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,739.83,"with the highest"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,credibility, not surprising.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,742.67,"Mattis said that he wanted the"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,military to do a test program,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,745.23,"with Theranos analyzers, but"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,the tests never happened.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,747.94,"Balwani and Holmes told investors"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,749.39,"that they didn't need FDA"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,approval for the machines,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,751.22,"and tests when they already"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,knew that they needed clearance,""

Wsd6WoKWW2g,754.7,"And the two also allegedly"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,lied to the media,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,756.86,"and then used the articles"

Wsd6WoKWW2g,759.56,"their lies to promote"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,Theranos to investors.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,761.98,"And to find Holmes guilty"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,of the conspiracy charges,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,764.23,"the jury had to believe"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,that she hatched a plan,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,766.2,"to commit wire fraud in partnership"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,with Balwani, or others.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,769.56,"If the jurors thought that she"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,just went along with Balwani,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,771.8,"because of their partnership,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,773.26,"that probably wouldn't have risen"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,774.71,"to the level of conspiracy."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,776.29,"But what about the other charges of fraud"

Wsd6WoKWW2g,780.52,"The jury actually acquitted"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,Holmes of wire fraud,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,782.82,"and conspiracy to defraud patients."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,784.76,"So let's talk about why"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,that likely happened.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,787.2,"During the four-month trial,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,the prosecution devoted,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,789.36,"very little time to proving"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,this part of the case.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,792.06,"The patients who purchased"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,Theranos tests only testified,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,794.8,"for about one hour in total."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,796.89,"The government accused Holmes"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,798.1,"and Theranos of making"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,material misrepresentations,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,800.41,"about its Edison machine"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,in advertisements.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,802.56,"The ads mostly targeted physicians."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,804.83,"The prosecution argued"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,that these ads induced,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,807.16,"hundreds of patients to"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,pay Theranos, or Walgreens,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,809.56,"for blood tests and test results,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,811.19,"which obviously wouldn't have worked."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,813.06,"The government said Balwani"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,and Holmes told doctors,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,815.45,"and patients that Theranos"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,could provide accurate, fast,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,817.91,"reliable, and cheap blood"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,tests and test results,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,820.45,"but they already knew that"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,Theranos technology was,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,822.68,"in fact not capable of"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,consistently producing accurate,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,825.13,"and reliable results."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,826.77,"This was the alleged wire fraud,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,828.36,"because Theranos used"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,interstate electronic wires,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,830.67,"to purchase advertisements intending"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,832.36,"to induce individuals to"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,buy the tests in Walgreens,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,835.8,"and stores in California and Arizona."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,838.12,"And the prosecution had"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,evidence that Theranos placed,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,840.34,"advertisements in Walgreens and on TV"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,842.68,"with their total marketing"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,effort slightly over $1 million.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,845.74,"But at the same time, the"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,prosecutors didn't have,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,847.6,"the same kinds of direct communications"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,849.21,"between Holmes and individual patients"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,851.46,"as they did between Holmes and investors."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,853.8,"And theoretically, patients"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,only used Theranos tests,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,856.04,"because they were referred"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,by their physicians.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,858.42,"So it's possible the"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,jury might have believed,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,860.05,"that there were too many"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,intermediaries between Holmes,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,862.41,"and the individual patients"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,863.83,"and doctors to conclude that"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,Holmes actually influenced,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,867.27,"the patients themselves."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,868.46,"And the defense argued that"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,the prosecution needed to show,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,870.78,"that Holmes really intended"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,to defraud these patients.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,873.75,"Arguably, her company gave"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,patients inaccurate test results,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,876.51,"but inaccurate test results"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,alone don't necessarily meet,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,879.22,"the criteria for an intent to defraud."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,881.78,"The prosecutors needed to"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,prove beyond a reasonable doubt,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,884.49,"that Holmes knowingly"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,participated in, devised,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,886.99,"or intended to devise a plan"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,to defraud these patients.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,889.8,"And as we talked about earlier,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,890.87,"generally, opinions, aspirations, goals,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,892.93,"or subjective beliefs can't"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,be used as a basis to find,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,895.69,"that someone made a false,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,or fraudulent representation.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,898.45,"And the jurors who spoke"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,out after the verdict said,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,900.45,"that they believed Holmes when she said"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,901.94,"she never intended to defraud patients."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,903.83,"And juror number six, Wayne"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,Katz, an Emmy-winning TV writer,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,906.99,"for a 1990s show called"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,"Tiny Toon Adventures,",""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,909.74,"was inspired by Holmes' testimony."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,912.15,"Quote, "We respected Elizabeth's"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,belief in her technology,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,915.337,""in her dream."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,916.277,""We thought, 'She still believes in it,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,917.877,""'and we still believe"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,she believes in it.'",""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,920.07,"He's saying that she"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,had a subjective belief,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,922.08,"even to this day, that she"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,was helping her patients,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,924.43,"not hurting them."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,925.31,"Katz said that the jury quickly"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,decided to acquit Holmes,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,927.77,"on all four counts of"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,fraud against patients.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,929.97,"The jury thought Holmes"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,was one step removed,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,932.52,"from the patients, so that they"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,were not directly defrauded.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,935.33,"Of course, this was also"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,somewhat contradictory,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,937.03,"since Katz also opined that"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,everything ran through Holmes.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,940.5,"But this is just what"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,you often get from jurors,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,942.13,"who are grappling with"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,difficult questions of law.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,944.77,"Mike Kew, juror number 11, said"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,946.48,"that although the panel thought"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,Holmes' credibility was low,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,949.46,"they also believed that she was genuine."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,951.2,"But what happens next?"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,952.37,"Each of the four counts that"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,Holmes was convicted of carries,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,954.38,"a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,956.96,"So theoretically, she could"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,get 80 years in prison,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,959.21,"but this will be reduced"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,960.69,"and modified by the federal"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,sentencing guidelines.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,963.78,"Several former prosecutors think"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,965.03,"she'll probably get less"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,than 20 years in prison,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,967.47,"especially as a first-time offender,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,969.33,"and the high-profile nature of the case"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,971.16,"and the scope of the"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,fraud probably suggest,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,972.65,"that she won't exactly get"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,a slap on the wrist, though.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,975.01,"That's because the federal"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,sentencing guidelines require,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,976.91,"the judge to consider"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,the magnitude of the lies,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,979.15,"and how much money the investors lost,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,981.57,"and the fact that she was CEO."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,983.74,"In these kinds of white collar crimes,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,985.55,"the more money that is pilfered,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,988.62,"the more prison you could get,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,990.02,"and $140 million is quite a lot,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,993.41,"though Holmes may be"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,able to sway the judge,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,995.35,"for less prison time by"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,pointing to her relative youth,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,997.61,"her capacity for change,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,999.02,"and the allegations of abuse"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,at the hands of Balwani,,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,1001.89,"and there will almost"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,certainly be a very hefty fine.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,1004.47,"The government can retry her"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,1006.01,"on the other wire fraud charges,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,but that seems unlikely.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,1008.63,"The government has already"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,spent significant resources,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,1010.94,"and time on the case,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,1011.92,"and they got a conviction"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,on four counts carrying,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,1014.24,"a serious prison sentence."
Wsd6WoKWW2g,1016.03,"So that may be enough,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,particularly in light,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,1018.03,"of the upcoming Balwani trial,"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,1019.44,"which is also probably going"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,to be an expensive prosecution.,""
Wsd6WoKWW2g,1022.94,"So it turns out that Theranos was a fraud"
Wsd6WoKWW2g,1024.497,"and a terrible investment."

WYABEGnUD54,25.88,"the front kick."
WYABEGnUD54,36.42,"(Lesson 8. Front kick.)"
WYABEGnUD54,38.7,"We use this kick"
WYABEGnUD54,40.76,"when we're standing too far to hit the groin."
WYABEGnUD54,43.39,"With a knee."
WYABEGnUD54,44.72,"Or when we have to move closer to use our knee,"
WYABEGnUD54,47.52,"and we don't want to do that."
WYABEGnUD54,50.2,"So we're standing..."
WYABEGnUD54,51.58,"a little farther."
WYABEGnUD54,53.64,"And we just kick."
WYABEGnUD54,55.69,"This is.. a long-distance attack."
WYABEGnUD54,59.37,"We're standing quite far apart."
WYABEGnUD54,62.44,"We can stand even further."
WYABEGnUD54,65.98,"I won't reach from here, put if i take a step..."
WYABEGnUD54,69.52,"then I can..."
WYABEGnUD54,71.84,"reach. I can even reach from there."
WYABEGnUD54,78.84,"These are the advantages of this strike."
WYABEGnUD54,81.07,"So where do we kick?"
WYABEGnUD54,83.4,"In the groin. You won't believe it."
WYABEGnUD54,85.68,"Not just there."
WYABEGnUD54,87.08,"(Aiming.)"
WYABEGnUD54,89.23,"So where should we kick?"

WYABEGnUD54,100.94,"-Putting up a calf."
WYABEGnUD54,-Knees.,""

WYABEGnUD54,116.6,"Knees are expensive."
WYABEGnUD54,118.51,"The risk of this resulting in a serious injury is quite high."
WYABEGnUD54,123.66,"There is an alternative option,"
WYABEGnUD54,125.63,"which we can use if we're wearing heavy boots."
WYABEGnUD54,129.08,"With heavy soles,"
WYABEGnUD54,130.81,"and a hard toe cap."
WYABEGnUD54,133.37,"We can hit the calf."
WYABEGnUD54,136.01,"We can, it's not a priority, but we can."
WYABEGnUD54,138.86,"It's also a good option"
WYABEGnUD54,141.93,"if a colleague is harassing you at an office party."

WYABEGnUD54,146.43,"If we're wearing heavy boots, then it doesn't matter,"

WYABEGnUD54,153.63,"Knees, calves, or groin."
WYABEGnUD54,157.39,"However if we're wearing"

WYABEGnUD54,- Basically we need to pull our toes up when we attack.,""
WYABEGnUD54,190.83,"The this striking surface is opened."
WYABEGnUD54,193.74,"The hitting angle is 45 degrees."
WYABEGnUD54,195.56,"This way the kick affects all the hitting points."
WYABEGnUD54,199.82,"To be sure"
WYABEGnUD54,we need to imagine that the impact point,""
WYABEGnUD54,204.08,"is not the groin,"
WYABEGnUD54,206.08,"but somewhere around the tailbone level."
WYABEGnUD54,208.62,"This way we can trick our brain."
WYABEGnUD54,212.73,"When you start training and you imagine"
WYABEGnUD54,216.11,"the exact point where you want to hit,"
WYABEGnUD54,219.04,"then the kick gets weaker on approach."
WYABEGnUD54,221.45,"There's a life hack for this."
WYABEGnUD54,223.45,"In order to kick harder,"
WYABEGnUD54,225.85,"we have to aim a little further"
WYABEGnUD54,227.74,"from the actual impact point."
WYABEGnUD54,230.25,"If I wanna hit my wife in the nose,"
WYABEGnUD54,232.2,"then I will aim through"
WYABEGnUD54,234.51,"to the back of her head"
WYABEGnUD54,or somewhere inside her brain.,""
WYABEGnUD54,240.41,"Another striking surface"
WYABEGnUD54,for this kick is the calf.,""
WYABEGnUD54,243.63,"If the distance is..."
WYABEGnUD54,244.99,"a little closer, somewhere between a knee strike"
WYABEGnUD54,248.08,"and a full front kick, then you use your calf."
WYABEGnUD54,251.87,"If we’re on a street"
WYABEGnUD54,254.4,"it might slip over here to the foot in some cases"
WYABEGnUD54,257.312,"it’s okay, but it’s better"
WYABEGnUD54,259.58,"to hit with a harder part"
WYABEGnUD54,of the leg, which is the calf.,""

WYABEGnUD54,299.04,"then we throw the..."
WYABEGnUD54,300.88,"the rest of our leg."
WYABEGnUD54,302.83,"Yes. But we have to avoid fixating the joint."
WYABEGnUD54,306.65,"If you deliver a nice strong kick"
WYABEGnUD54,309.28,"and fully straighten your leg,"
WYABEGnUD54,then you risk damaging you knee.,""
WYABEGnUD54,313.74,"When you extend you leg,"
WYABEGnUD54,317.29,"the perfect angle on impact"
WYABEGnUD54,319.69,"is about 45 degrees"
WYABEGnUD54,322.0,"from a straight line."
WYABEGnUD54,323.98,"Something like this."
WYABEGnUD54,325.72,"Imagine that you’re hitting a football."
WYABEGnUD54,328.72,"(Check point: The leg is slightly bent.)"
WYABEGnUD54,333.24,"This strike can also be delivered"
WYABEGnUD54,334.72,"from a semi-passive stance"
WYABEGnUD54,336.72,"or even a passive stance, when a person..."

WYABEGnUD54,349.12,"(Check point: From any stance.)"
WYABEGnUD54,353.02,"Important note:"
WYABEGnUD54,any time we start actively striking,,""
WYABEGnUD54,357.4,"we have to put our hands up"

WYABEGnUD54,362.48,"After the first strike I put my hands up."
WYABEGnUD54,366.41,"In particular we put our hands up"

WYABEGnUD54,377.344,"(Check point: Put your hands up.)"
WYABEGnUD54,381.04,"Open hand strikes work really well here."
WYABEGnUD54,383.76,"Because if there's been"
WYABEGnUD54,a successful kick in the groin,,""
WYABEGnUD54,387.55,"then the guy is gonna fold, or something,"

WYABEGnUD54,- What can happen after a kick,""
WYABEGnUD54,396.64,"in the groin."

WYABEGnUD54,- Somehow it works.,""
WYABEGnUD54,413.63,"Yes."
WYABEGnUD54,415.36,"What else can we do..."
WYABEGnUD54,419.39,"There's different impact points:"
WYABEGnUD54,421.76,"it can be the nose, or the chin,"
WYABEGnUD54,425.16,"because I bent down slightly."
WYABEGnUD54,433.87,"The third option:"
WYABEGnUD54,435.92,"if the guy got a critical"
WYABEGnUD54,438.4,"hit in the balls and basically just cramped."
WYABEGnUD54,448.25,"Here the back of the head is exposed,"
WYABEGnUD54,450.54,"so we can hit there,"
WYABEGnUD54,452.89,"or on the neck, which is better,"
WYABEGnUD54,455.31,"because if you overdo it"
WYABEGnUD54,with a hummer punch on the head, it'll be a felony.,""
WYABEGnUD54,459.4,"What else can you do, when kicking in the groin."
WYABEGnUD54,467.45,"The most basic"
WYABEGnUD54,469.29,"intuitive thing a man does"
WYABEGnUD54,472.17,"to protect his groin is either"
WYABEGnUD54,474.59,"clenching his legs and jumping back."
WYABEGnUD54,478.33,"And then... that's right."
WYABEGnUD54,482.016,"Or a more advanced move,"
WYABEGnUD54,which is turning the hips.,""
WYABEGnUD54,487.31,"It's more of a... it's something"
WYABEGnUD54,490.56,"professional athletes do."
WYABEGnUD54,492.64,"They don't waste time on pointless move,"
WYABEGnUD54,496.88,"the just turn the hips and get to business."
WYABEGnUD54,500.44,"Nevertheless, we still"
WYABEGnUD54,502.49,"focus on our lower body"
WYABEGnUD54,505.8,"after turning the hips."
WYABEGnUD54,508.44,"And that's when the open-hand strikes come in."
WYABEGnUD54,511.53,"You asked if we could hummer punch,"
WYABEGnUD54,we can, but probably,""
WYABEGnUD54,515.0,"after a knee strike, because we need to be closer."
WYABEGnUD54,518.78,"So if you use the knee, then you hummer punch."
WYABEGnUD54,522.59,"And if you kick, then it's better to..."
WYABEGnUD54,526.44,"Let's talk briefly about practicing"
WYABEGnUD54,the knee strike and the front kick.,""
WYABEGnUD54,530.64,"As we said before, you need"
WYABEGnUD54,532.46,"a backpack full of blankets or something like that."
WYABEGnUD54,536.22,"You put it on..."
WYABEGnUD54,540.09,"your leg."
WYABEGnUD54,541.85,"Or you can stick your arms out straight."
WYABEGnUD54,545.4,"Opinions differ on this. I prefer using my leg and shifting"
WYABEGnUD54,548.97,"all the weight to the other one."
WYABEGnUD54,551.93,"And my front leg barely touches the ground."
WYABEGnUD54,554.94,"This is to ensure that if I receive a hard hit, I don't damage my joints."
WYABEGnUD54,560.27,"But there's a disadvantage:"
WYABEGnUD54,562.0,"when you start practicing hits, you lack accuracy"
WYABEGnUD54,565.26,"and in this case you might hit"
WYABEGnUD54,568.33,"the spots, that are not protected by the backpack."
WYABEGnUD54,571.92,"To eliminate this risk,"
WYABEGnUD54,573.63,"at first you can try"
WYABEGnUD54,576.01,"practicing with a backpack held straight out."
WYABEGnUD54,580.48,"Your arms have to be stiff."
WYABEGnUD54,582.75,"You cannot bend your arms, you have to hold it straight."
WYABEGnUD54,587.408,"Because any hard hit will impact your joints."
WYABEGnUD54,592.28,"If you don't keep it tight."
WYABEGnUD54,598.4,"Every time you hit - exhale."
WYABEGnUD54,604.43,"What this kick can look like in teal life."
WYABEGnUD54,608.03,"- Yo, girl, what's up?"

XmsWWbLMOUk,1136.48,"copper here in the elements because that"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1138.799,"means"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1139.679,"it's time to build we have been what 17"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1143.76,"hours now we have been going and we've"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1146.72,"gathered a lot of blocks a lot of"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1149.12,"materials and of course we built the"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1151.2,"tree in our last episode but the"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1153.039,"platform it's fun it's cute but we need"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1155.679,"to do something bigger and better with"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1158.48,"it so"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1159.679,"with that for the first time in 2022"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1162.88,"let's hit super fast build mode"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1170.06,"[Music]"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1178.16,"welp there goes our time lapse the"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1180.559,"server kicks you if you are inactive on"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1183.12,"the server for more than five minutes"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1184.64,"and that's just to keep you from wasting"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1186.64,"any extra time in your countdown and"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1188.799,"that also means if you log on with your"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1191.2,"spectator account to record a time lapse"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1193.28,"it kicks your spectator account now joel"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1195.76,"and green i think you use replay mod"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1198.32,"and i i just use a spectator account i'm"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1200.64,"just a simple man trying to make my way"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1202.48,"through the universe so until that's"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1204.88,"fixed sadly no time lapses but as a"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1208.08,"consolation prize we've got the start of"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1210.64,"our house nearly complete and i'm loving"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1213.919,"every minute of it look at that"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1215.2,"beautiful house with its copper roof and"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1217.6,"all the different little accent colors"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1219.84,"we've got flower baskets we have no"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1222.159,"windows because apparently i have no"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1224.0,"sand so i need to do that i've just been"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1226.0,"way too lazy to go down and get some but"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1228.96,"we do have some additional flower"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1230.32,"baskets that need some life i've tried"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1232.24,"some different flowers in them and they"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1233.44,"look kind of hokey so we'll keep"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1234.88,"thinking on that and we got the chain"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1237.52,"holding the tree and i think for the"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1239.76,"most part i think the tree now makes"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1241.84,"more sense on how it is hanging over so"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1244.48,"much because of the weight in the sheer"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1247.039,"size of this house just being a little"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1248.96,"bit cartoonish and a bit stylized i"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1250.96,"think it looks so so so much better"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1253.2,"we've still got a few details to install"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1255.36,"on the exterior and still put together"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1257.039,"the full interior but i'd like to turn"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1258.64,"my attention to some other builds here"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1260.48,"like our mine and our farms and what"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1263.84,"have i done with my hot bar i am now"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1265.919,"holding my meat my axe is in the off"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1268.08,"hand"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1269.039,"we've got villagers roaming the land"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1272.24,"but anyway as i said i want to start"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1273.6,"working on the farms i want to start"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1275.2,"working on the kind of the pathways that"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1277.679,"connect all of the cliffs i'm just in"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1279.76,"the building mood my friends well i've"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1282.0,"gotten a little carried away and our"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1283.76,"base just got a massive upgrade we've"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1286.4,"got a mine shaft we have a staircase"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1288.64,"farms and are a beautiful house you can"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1292.24,"see that i cleaned up the bottom a"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1293.6,"little bit on the house the farms have"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1295.84,"been spruced up slightly still want to"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1297.52,"work on them a little bit more have our"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1299.44,"fun little uh ladder going down into the"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1302.4,"mines with its mine cart and that ladder"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1304.32,"continues a little further down as you"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1305.919,"can see into a spiraling cave that leads"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1309.6,"right up into the house so"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1312.48,"let's get a closer look at all the stuff"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1314.72,"we did oh oh oh no oh oh no it stings so"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1318.159,"much oh okay okay"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1320.64,"those"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1322.24,"those berry bushes are all going to be"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1324.24,"burnt for my safety who'd have thought"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1326.4,"the arch enemy of this series was going"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1327.919,"to be a berry bush i love the little"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1330.24,"ladder house this wait wait hold on that"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1333.12,"is not the right block there how did i"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1335.28,"miss that"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1336.4,"anyway"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1337.36,"let's walk through here and this will"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1339.76,"take us down to everything to our mine"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1343.36,"our farms and of course our house so"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1346.799,"we've got this cool little mine cart"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1348.799,"here and then if we walk inside you can"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1351.2,"see this little cave and then follow the"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1353.84,"minecart tracks into our mine here and"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1357.12,"man i had so much fun putting this all"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1358.96,"together i really got in the zone got in"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1361.039,"a nice old flow state and just uh"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1363.919,"started rolling it's been a couple hours"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1366.0,"for sure and now this part is a little"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1368.4,"bit ugly so bear with me is still a work"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1371.44,"in progress this little pathway that i"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1373.679,"have cut along the cliff which then"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1377.36,"leads under our farms into our brand new"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1382.4,"house which has a completed interior so"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1385.2,"we have our wall of barrels and we've"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1387.2,"got these fun little trees that have"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1389.28,"grown up the sides of the building we"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1391.44,"have our smelters of course and then all"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1394.08,"the way to the top of the staircase"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1396.559,"finds our bed and of course the vibe"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1400.08,"machine there and out these windows you"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1401.919,"can see our farm now"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1404.4,"i'm not still 100 satisfied with them"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1406.96,"but i think they look a little bit"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1408.64,"better than they did originally so i'm"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1411.919,"definitely going to continue to work on"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1413.28,"these i've thought of some fun ways to"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1414.72,"make these not functionable but looks"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1417.12,"like irrigation"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1418.64,"ladders that go up and down i think"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1420.64,"could be really really cool but if we"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1422.24,"pop out the back door here at the plank"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1425.44,"you can see how the minecart's on the"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1427.36,"edge there and of course our little"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1428.96,"pathway which in our next episode we are"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1430.559,"going to fix up and make it a look a lot"
XmsWWbLMOUk,1432.72,"lot better"

YHwU5NMWIRE,191.03,"picking you up actually is who they say"
YHwU5NMWIRE,192.65,"they are inside make sure that you wait"
YHwU5NMWIRE,195.86,"inside for your driver to show up and"
YHwU5NMWIRE,198.17,"the app sends you a notification when"
YHwU5NMWIRE,200.69,"the driver arrives so that you can be"
YHwU5NMWIRE,202.34,"waiting inside and this lessens the"
YHwU5NMWIRE,204.049,"chance of you waiting outside and"
YHwU5NMWIRE,206.03,"similar to this case somebody saw"
YHwU5NMWIRE,208.04,"somebody waiting knew that they were"
YHwU5NMWIRE,209.54,"waiting for a ride whether it be a taxi"
YHwU5NMWIRE,212.12,"or an uber and they posed as that driver"
YHwU5NMWIRE,213.859,"so this lessens the likelihood of that"
YHwU5NMWIRE,215.48,"occurring if you're waiting inside of"
YHwU5NMWIRE,218.12,"your of your location absolute if"
YHwU5NMWIRE,219.829,"whenever possible that is ideal and then"
YHwU5NMWIRE,221.93,"remaining in touch usually these"
YHwU5NMWIRE,223.4,"ride-sharing services the app allows you"
YHwU5NMWIRE,225.32,"to share the details of your trip you"
YHwU5NMWIRE,227.6,"can share those details with a friend or"
YHwU5NMWIRE,229.1,"family member so they know where you are"
YHwU5NMWIRE,230.15,"at all times and can check in to make"
YHwU5NMWIRE,232.34,"sure everything's okay with your friends"
YHwU5NMWIRE,234.859,"and family let them know where you're"
YHwU5NMWIRE,236.12,"going now if you do everything right all"
YHwU5NMWIRE,239.269,"of these situations all of these details"
YHwU5NMWIRE,240.769,"it's still possible that you are"
YHwU5NMWIRE,242.989,"assaulted so that being said if you are"
YHwU5NMWIRE,245.39,"trapped in a vehicle if you can escape"
YHwU5NMWIRE,248.66,"the vehicle if you can't and maybe"
YHwU5NMWIRE,251.66,"you're in the backseat in a situation"
YHwU5NMWIRE,253.76,"where the attacker is assaulting you"
YHwU5NMWIRE,255.53,"there are things you can do now we as"
YHwU5NMWIRE,257.66,"jujitsu"
YHwU5NMWIRE,258.62,"instructors of course run the database"
YHwU5NMWIRE,261.229,"of techniques that we know and ask"
YHwU5NMWIRE,262.639,"ourselves two questions what can be"
YHwU5NMWIRE,264.139,"effective for a smaller person who gets"
YHwU5NMWIRE,265.669,"a larger more athletic opponent and what"
YHwU5NMWIRE,267.919,"can be effective in the confines of the"
YHwU5NMWIRE,269.54,"back seat of a vehicle and unfortunately"
YHwU5NMWIRE,272.3,"striking is not ideal in these"
YHwU5NMWIRE,273.86,"situations partly because you're so"
YHwU5NMWIRE,275.51,"confined that you don't have the proper"
YHwU5NMWIRE,277.729,"range of distance to strike not to"
YHwU5NMWIRE,279.68,"mention whatever distant range or"
YHwU5NMWIRE,281.33,"distance you have he also has on you and"
YHwU5NMWIRE,283.4,"so that he can strike us right back"
YHwU5NMWIRE,284.75,"right not only that you know submission"
YHwU5NMWIRE,287.99,"we have several submissions in the"
YHwU5NMWIRE,289.49,"Gracie jiu-jitsu database to pull from"
YHwU5NMWIRE,291.65,"but many of them require extension and"
YHwU5NMWIRE,294.34,"openings such as arm bars or you know"
YHwU5NMWIRE,297.139,"joint locks where you lock something and"
YHwU5NMWIRE,298.82,"you stretch and you create that opening"
YHwU5NMWIRE,300.41,"the problem isn't the confines of a you"
YHwU5NMWIRE,302.03,"know the ceiling of the vehicle there"
YHwU5NMWIRE,303.53,"your feet running into the vehicle you"
YHwU5NMWIRE,304.97,"might not be able to hyperextend the"
YHwU5NMWIRE,306.02,"joint effectively and it could aggravate"
YHwU5NMWIRE,307.85,"the situation so ultimately what this"
YHwU5NMWIRE,309.38,"boils down to is chokes chokes chokes"
YHwU5NMWIRE,311.21,"chokes chokes three chokes you want to"
YHwU5NMWIRE,313.97,"teach the most basic and effective"
YHwU5NMWIRE,315.8,"chokes in the arsenal starting with the"
YHwU5NMWIRE,317.33,"guillotine choke the guard is a very"
YHwU5NMWIRE,318.919,"common position in jujitsu during a"
YHwU5NMWIRE,320.72,"sexual assault it may be the final"
YHwU5NMWIRE,322.01,"destination for the attacker but if you"
YHwU5NMWIRE,323.75,"know what you're doing on bottom it's a"
YHwU5NMWIRE,325.22,"position of power and there are amazing"
YHwU5NMWIRE,326.93,"things you can do from here"
YHwU5NMWIRE,328.19,"so guard stage one is where he begins"
YHwU5NMWIRE,330.289,"she has me closed inside her guard check"
YHwU5NMWIRE,332.3,"out this first choke it's called the"
YHwU5NMWIRE,333.349,"guillotine oh six seconds you're"
YHwU5NMWIRE,341.27,"unconscious deep show us what you did"
YHwU5NMWIRE,343.51,"his weight is a little bit too heavy on"
YHwU5NMWIRE,345.83,"me so I use my legs to kind of push off"
YHwU5NMWIRE,347.75,"his weight so that I can get his head"
YHwU5NMWIRE,349.19,"underneath my arm I stuff it under the"
YHwU5NMWIRE,351.169,"arm now I want to sit up completely so"
YHwU5NMWIRE,356.18,"that I can shoot the choke connect my"
YHwU5NMWIRE,358.37,"hands and now sit back underneath him"
YHwU5NMWIRE,360.83,"here now while I'm extending my legs and"
YHwU5NMWIRE,363.02,"curling the show there it is"
YHwU5NMWIRE,372.04,"so if sitting up is not an option for"
YHwU5NMWIRE,374.66,"the guillotine show if there's another"
YHwU5NMWIRE,375.77,"amazing crossroad you can use when the"
YHwU5NMWIRE,378.05,"person is wearing a shirt or a jacket of"
YHwU5NMWIRE,379.49,"any kind and in six seconds the person"
YHwU5NMWIRE,389.72,"who's unconscious shows what you did"
YHwU5NMWIRE,390.919,"even so right here we call this stage"
YHwU5NMWIRE,392.87,"one of the punch block series where I'm"
YHwU5NMWIRE,394.22,"controlling his head in his arm so that"
YHwU5NMWIRE,395.69,"he can't punch me from this position"
YHwU5NMWIRE,396.919,"closeness is my friend here now I reach"
YHwU5NMWIRE,399.71,"back and I gather his shirt together to"
YHwU5NMWIRE,401.96,"get a good grip on his shirt now my hand"
YHwU5NMWIRE,404.09,"will come around and I'll create this"
YHwU5NMWIRE,406.55,"grip here palm up and my other hand will"
YHwU5NMWIRE,409.22,"hand off and my thumb will go inside and"
YHwU5NMWIRE,412.07,"gripping his shirt here now I can put my"
YHwU5NMWIRE,414.26,"foot on the hip and create distance just"
YHwU5NMWIRE,416.51,"enough to get my arm around his head"
YHwU5NMWIRE,418.07,"here keeping my head close so that you"
YHwU5NMWIRE,421.04,"can't punch me and now the shoulder"
YHwU5NMWIRE,424.82,"blades"
YHwU5NMWIRE,434.16,"so in a situation where Eve cannot pull"
YHwU5NMWIRE,437.23,"me down and close the distance here"
YHwU5NMWIRE,439.27,"because the person is too far away watch"
YHwU5NMWIRE,440.32,"what she does and in six seconds he's"
YHwU5NMWIRE,446.5,"unconscious just like the other choice"
YHwU5NMWIRE,447.76,"so from here this is called the triangle"
YHwU5NMWIRE,449.8,"choke and all I want is his head and one"
YHwU5NMWIRE,452.89,"arm inside my legs and so to do that I"
YHwU5NMWIRE,455.53,"can kind of move one arm out of the way"
YHwU5NMWIRE,457.63,"while my legs come up and around his"
YHwU5NMWIRE,461.29,"body here so I'm securing it head and an"
YHwU5NMWIRE,463.42,"arm"
YHwU5NMWIRE,463.81,"I want to swipe this arm out of the way"
YHwU5NMWIRE,465.94,"so that he can't reach my face and now"
YHwU5NMWIRE,468.58,"from here I can control his head my foot"
YHwU5NMWIRE,471.1,"can go in his hip to create the angle"
YHwU5NMWIRE,472.84,"that I need to grab my own shin and now"
YHwU5NMWIRE,475.93,"lock my leg over my own ankle here and"
YHwU5NMWIRE,478.63,"now this is the triangle position you"
YHwU5NMWIRE,480.61,"see the triangle with my legs it's a"
YHwU5NMWIRE,482.02,"beautiful choke I can control his head"
YHwU5NMWIRE,484.12,"here and I squeeze with my thighs and"
YHwU5NMWIRE,486.67,"six seconds"
YHwU5NMWIRE,498.19,"so these are the three chokes that we"
YHwU5NMWIRE,500.18,"think that every woman should know but"
YHwU5NMWIRE,501.92,"more importantly we would also like to"
YHwU5NMWIRE,503.72,"invite women all over the world to"

Yov854ZT1lg,509.759,"or mvac engine"
Yov854ZT1lg,511.599,"once the first and second stages"
Yov854ZT1lg,513.36,"separate at about two and a half minutes"
Yov854ZT1lg,515.12,"into the mission that single mvac engine"
Yov854ZT1lg,517.76,"will ignite and carry the starling"
Yov854ZT1lg,519.68,"satellites to a low earth orbit around"
Yov854ZT1lg,522.0,"the earth"
Yov854ZT1lg,524.159,"you'll also notice that large nose cone"
Yov854ZT1lg,526.32,"at the very top of the rocket this is"
Yov854ZT1lg,528.24,"the payload fairing and it protects our"
Yov854ZT1lg,530.32,"sterling satellites until the vehicle is"
Yov854ZT1lg,532.56,"outside the earth's atmosphere at which"
Yov854ZT1lg,534.64,"point we don't need it anymore and the"
Yov854ZT1lg,536.399,"fairings will separate to expose the"
Yov854ZT1lg,538.72,"satellites to space"
Yov854ZT1lg,541.04,"just as we reuse falcon 9 we also"
Yov854ZT1lg,543.04,"recover and reuse our fairing halves"
Yov854ZT1lg,545.519,"the fairing halves we're using tonight"
Yov854ZT1lg,547.12,"are flight proven"
Yov854ZT1lg,548.88,"and tonight's flight will be the second"
Yov854ZT1lg,550.56,"flight for both of these fairing halves"
Yov854ZT1lg,553.12,"we are planning to recover these halves"
Yov854ZT1lg,555.12,"again using our recovery vessel dug once"
Yov854ZT1lg,557.839,"they return to earth"
Yov854ZT1lg,576.64,"propellants have been loading on the"
Yov854ZT1lg,578.08,"vehicle since t minus 35 minutes now"
Yov854ZT1lg,581.04,"again falcon 9 is a bi-propellant"
Yov854ZT1lg,583.04,"vehicle which means it uses two"
Yov854ZT1lg,584.56,"propellants a fuel and an oxidizer an"
Yov854ZT1lg,587.6,"oxidizer is a type of chemical that a"
Yov854ZT1lg,589.519,"fuel requires in order to burn so for"
Yov854ZT1lg,591.839,"falcon 9 our fuel is a refined form of"
Yov854ZT1lg,594.399,"kerosene known as rp1 and our oxidizer"
Yov854ZT1lg,597.68,"is a super chilled liquid oxygen also"
Yov854ZT1lg,600.0,"called lox now the liquid oxygen is"
Yov854ZT1lg,602.64,"chilled well below its boiling point so"
Yov854ZT1lg,604.8,"that it becomes what we call densified"
Yov854ZT1lg,607.6,"and this just means that it has a much"
Yov854ZT1lg,609.519,"greater amount of mass per volume and"
Yov854ZT1lg,611.68,"means we can load more of it into the"
Yov854ZT1lg,613.36,"booster"
Yov854ZT1lg,614.72,"additionally falcon 9 also needs an"
Yov854ZT1lg,616.64,"ignition source in order to go and for"
Yov854ZT1lg,619.279,"that we use the chemical t tub or trisol"
Yov854ZT1lg,622.079,"aluminum and triethyl boring"
Yov854ZT1lg,625.279,"once it's fully fueled falcon 9 holds"
Yov854ZT1lg,627.44,"just over a million pounds of propellant"
Yov854ZT1lg,629.519,"that the vehicle will burn through in"
Yov854ZT1lg,630.959,"less than three minutes after liftoff"
Yov854ZT1lg,635.6,"currently fuel is nearly fully loaded on"
Yov854ZT1lg,638.24,"stage one and already full on stage two"
Yov854ZT1lg,641.04,"liquid oxygen is nearly full on stage"
Yov854ZT1lg,644.0,"one and about eighty percent on stage"
Yov854ZT1lg,646.0,"two"
Yov854ZT1lg,647.12,"now once all the tanks are full both"
Yov854ZT1lg,649.2,"stages will continue to be topped off"
Yov854ZT1lg,650.959,"with liquid oxygen until t minus two"
Yov854ZT1lg,653.12,"minutes to keep the temperatures as cold"
Yov854ZT1lg,655.36,"as possible"
Yov854ZT1lg,657.76,"the latest weather forecast shows we're"
Yov854ZT1lg,659.44,"80 favorable for liftoff if for some"
Yov854ZT1lg,662.24,"reason we don't launch tonight we do"
Yov854ZT1lg,664.0,"have a backup opportunity tomorrow at 6"
Yov854ZT1lg,666.24,"40 pm eastern time"
Yov854ZT1lg,683.44,"stage one kilo is complete"
Yov854ZT1lg,687.76,"in a few minutes falcon 9 will lift off"
Yov854ZT1lg,690.32,"carrying our sterling satellites to low"
Yov854ZT1lg,692.24,"earth orbit now in order to get these"
Yov854ZT1lg,694.399,"satellites into space the rocket has to"
Yov854ZT1lg,696.32,"do more than just go up it also has to"
Yov854ZT1lg,698.56,"go sideways really really fast so at"
Yov854ZT1lg,701.12,"liftoff gravity is pulling straight down"
Yov854ZT1lg,703.04,"on the rocket and as we ascend we tilt"
Yov854ZT1lg,705.2,"the engines technically called gimbling"
Yov854ZT1lg,707.76,"and that turns the rocket horizontally"
Yov854ZT1lg,710.399,"we're still going up but now we're also"
Yov854ZT1lg,712.16,"headed horizontally away from the launch"
Yov854ZT1lg,714.24,"pad this is what we call a gravity turn"
Yov854ZT1lg,717.12,"the rocket typically needs to go 17 500"
Yov854ZT1lg,720.079,"miles per hour horizontally in order to"
Yov854ZT1lg,722.48,"avoid being pulled back down to earth"
Yov854ZT1lg,724.32,"and actually get into orbit to help"
Yov854ZT1lg,726.399,"demonstrate this concept imagine firing"
Yov854ZT1lg,728.48,"a cannon from a really high mountain"
Yov854ZT1lg,730.959,"the cannonball will arc and then gravity"
Yov854ZT1lg,732.959,"will pull it down to earth"
Yov854ZT1lg,734.88,"as you increase the power the cannonball"
Yov854ZT1lg,736.639,"will arc and land further and further"
Yov854ZT1lg,738.32,"away"
Yov854ZT1lg,739.519,"eventually if you could continue to"
Yov854ZT1lg,741.2,"increase the power enough the cannonball"
Yov854ZT1lg,743.2,"will be going so fast that it ends up in"
Yov854ZT1lg,745.44,"free fall around the earth gravity is"
Yov854ZT1lg,747.92,"still pulling down on the cannonball but"
Yov854ZT1lg,749.839,"it's going so fast that it never"
Yov854ZT1lg,751.36,"actually hits the ground"
Yov854ZT1lg,752.959,"this arc which constantly misses the"
Yov854ZT1lg,754.639,"earth is called an orb thanks for"
Yov854ZT1lg,756.24,"pressurizing for strongback retract"
Yov854ZT1lg,759.519,"so when we get to liftoff today keep an"
Yov854ZT1lg,761.519,"eye on the orientation of falcon 9"
Yov854ZT1lg,763.68,"you'll see that we'll go straight up"
Yov854ZT1lg,765.519,"until about t plus 10 seconds at which"
Yov854ZT1lg,768.0,"point we begin that shift in orientation"
Yov854ZT1lg,770.399,"so falcon 9 can go sideways really fast"
Yov854ZT1lg,773.44,"but before we get into that let's check"
Yov854ZT1lg,775.12,"in on the status of the vehicle for"
Yov854ZT1lg,776.8,"today's launch"
Yov854ZT1lg,777.92,"[Music]"
Yov854ZT1lg,781.6,"we are currently just under t minus four"
Yov854ZT1lg,784.079,"and a half minutes from liftoff come"
Yov854ZT1lg,785.36,"back retract it started of our 36th"
Yov854ZT1lg,787.68,"launch of starlink"
Yov854ZT1lg,789.519,"and you just heard the call out that"
Yov854ZT1lg,791.2,"that trust structure or the te has begun"
Yov854ZT1lg,794.399,"retraction"
Yov854ZT1lg,799.12,"in preparation for that retraction that"
Yov854ZT1lg,801.6,"those te clamps you see right below the"
Yov854ZT1lg,804.24,"fairing there will begin to"
Yov854ZT1lg,806.88,"open up to allow the transporter erector"
Yov854ZT1lg,809.76,"to retract you can see those clamps"
Yov854ZT1lg,811.92,"opening now"
Yov854ZT1lg,818.8,"the transporter erector will begin to"
Yov854ZT1lg,820.56,"pull away from the rocket slightly"
Yov854ZT1lg,822.72,"before at t zero the hydraulics will"
Yov854ZT1lg,825.04,"pull the transporter erector even"

Yov854ZT1lg,829.92,"lifts off"

Yov854ZT1lg,841.36,"fairing and the starling satellites"

Yov854ZT1lg,1131.6,"that the stage sees"
Yov854ZT1lg,1133.36,"next we'll have three events happening"
Yov854ZT1lg,1135.039,"in quick succession"
Yov854ZT1lg,1136.72,"first we'll have main engine cutoff"
Yov854ZT1lg,1138.48,"followed by stage separation and then"
Yov854ZT1lg,1140.88,"second engine startup one"
Yov854ZT1lg,1142.96,"now first main engine cutoff is where"
Yov854ZT1lg,1144.96,"all nine of those m1d engines on that"
Yov854ZT1lg,1147.44,"first stage will shut off to slow the"
Yov854ZT1lg,1149.679,"vehicle down in preparation for stage"
Yov854ZT1lg,1152.08,"separation this is where the first"
Yov854ZT1lg,1154.559,"engine show has begun"
Yov854ZT1lg,1156.16,"this is where the first and second"
Yov854ZT1lg,1157.76,"stages will separate with the first"
Yov854ZT1lg,1159.84,"stage starting to make its way back to"
Yov854ZT1lg,1161.6,"earth for landing while the second stage"
Yov854ZT1lg,1163.679,"continues on its journey to the third"
Yov854ZT1lg,1165.84,"event of second engine startup one and"
Yov854ZT1lg,1168.48,"this is where that single mvac engine on"
Yov854ZT1lg,1170.88,"the second stage will light up and"
Yov854ZT1lg,1172.64,"propel the second stage along with the"
Yov854ZT1lg,1174.48,"starling satellites to"
Yov854ZT1lg,1176.84,"orbit we're a little under 30 seconds"
Yov854ZT1lg,1179.84,"away from these three events"
Yov854ZT1lg,1182.08,"you'll want to watch out for fairing"
Yov854ZT1lg,1183.76,"deploy which is going to happen shortly"
Yov854ZT1lg,1185.44,"after that hopefully we get cool live"
Yov854ZT1lg,1187.6,"views from the second stage camera of"
Yov854ZT1lg,1189.52,"those fairing halves popping off"
Yov854ZT1lg,1207.52,"nico"
Yov854ZT1lg,1209.36,"stage separation confirmed"
Yov854ZT1lg,1211.84,"[Applause]"
Yov854ZT1lg,1213.44,"[Music]"
Yov854ZT1lg,1220.64,"wow beautiful views from the first stage"
Yov854ZT1lg,1223.28,"and second stage tracker"
Yov854ZT1lg,1225.12,"nominal trajectories"
Yov854ZT1lg,1226.96,"we did have successful mikko state"
Yov854ZT1lg,1229.44,"separation"
Yov854ZT1lg,1230.64,"there's fairing deployment"
Yov854ZT1lg,1232.84,"there again this what a cool view from"
Yov854ZT1lg,1235.679,"the second stage"
Yov854ZT1lg,1239.2,"again we did just have confirmation of"
Yov854ZT1lg,1241.28,"successful fairing deployment again"
Yov854ZT1lg,1243.76,"spacex has reflown the falcon fairing"
Yov854ZT1lg,1246.08,"have since november of 2019"
Yov854ZT1lg,1249.44,"again this was our second flight for"
Yov854ZT1lg,1251.039,"both of those and we will be attempting"
Yov854ZT1lg,1252.88,"to recover them on our recovery vessel"
Yov854ZT1lg,1255.039,"doug looks like you can just maybe make"
Yov854ZT1lg,1257.44,"out those fairing halves in that"
Yov854ZT1lg,1259.76,"live view from the ground"
Yov854ZT1lg,1262.72,"as they are flying away from the second"
Yov854ZT1lg,1265.12,"stage there"
Yov854ZT1lg,1268.72,"looks like that's the first stage maybe"
Yov854ZT1lg,1270.48,"also floating off to the left"
Yov854ZT1lg,1276.559,"now as stage two heads towards its"
Yov854ZT1lg,1278.64,"targeted drop-off orbit there stage one"
Yov854ZT1lg,1281.039,"will execute two burns in order to make"
Yov854ZT1lg,1283.44,"its way back home to earth"
Yov854ZT1lg,1285.6,"the first is an entry burn now this is"
Yov854ZT1lg,1288.4,"where three of the m1d engines will"
Yov854ZT1lg,1290.72,"reignite and this helps to slow the"
Yov854ZT1lg,1292.88,"stage down as it re-enters the upper"
Yov854ZT1lg,1295.12,"parts of the earth's atmosphere now the"
Yov854ZT1lg,1297.44,"second bird of course is the landing"
Yov854ZT1lg,1299.12,"burn and this is a single engine burn"
Yov854ZT1lg,1301.28,"that brings the vehicle speed down"
Yov854ZT1lg,1302.88,"rapidly in order to land on the drone"
Yov854ZT1lg,1311.44,"if you're just catching up with us we"
Yov854ZT1lg,1313.36,"had a successful launch of falcon 9 from"
Yov854ZT1lg,1316.08,"launch complex 39a at kennedy space"
Yov854ZT1lg,1318.559,"center and you're looking at a live view"
Yov854ZT1lg,1320.88,"from falcon 9's second stage"
Yov854ZT1lg,1323.679,"as it is delivering the our starling"
Yov854ZT1lg,1326.32,"payloads to orbit"
Yov854ZT1lg,1328.24,"stage one is currently making its way"
Yov854ZT1lg,1330.24,"back to our drone trip a shortfall of"
Yov854ZT1lg,1332.159,"gravitas in the atlantic ocean"
Yov854ZT1lg,1336.08,"we had beautiful views from the ground"
Yov854ZT1lg,1338.32,"of the first and second stage plumes"
Yov854ZT1lg,1340.64,"there just a little while ago"
Yov854ZT1lg,1348.32,"now the merlins on the first stage"
Yov854ZT1lg,1351.36,"are optimized for sea level so these"
Yov854ZT1lg,1353.6,"achieve 190 000 pounds of thrust during"
Yov854ZT1lg,1356.4,"ascent and descent and in contrast the"
Yov854ZT1lg,1358.96,"mvac engine which you see on your screen"
Yov854ZT1lg,1360.799,"right now is optimized for 220 500"
Yov854ZT1lg,1364.48,"pounds of thrust in vacuum"
Yov854ZT1lg,1367.52,"now the primary difference between these"
Yov854ZT1lg,1369.12,"two engines is just the size of the"
Yov854ZT1lg,1371.28,"nozzle the mvac nozzle is a lot larger"
Yov854ZT1lg,1374.24,"than the m1d nozzles on first stage"
Yov854ZT1lg,1381.28,"now the falcon 9 is equipped with four"
Yov854ZT1lg,1383.2,"hypersonic titanium grid fins positioned"
Yov854ZT1lg,1385.919,"near the top of the first stage and the"
Yov854ZT1lg,1388.4,"first stage is using these root fins to"
Yov854ZT1lg,1390.799,"help navigate and reorient itself as it"
Yov854ZT1lg,1394.0,"heads back home to earth"
Yov854ZT1lg,1406.159,"the first stage also has an attitude"
Yov854ZT1lg,1408.559,"control system which you can sometimes"
Yov854ZT1lg,1410.559,"see puffs of nitrogen gas coming from"
Yov854ZT1lg,1413.6,"and this attitude control system also"
Yov854ZT1lg,1415.76,"helps that first stage"
Yov854ZT1lg,1417.6,"orient itself as it returns home"
Yov854ZT1lg,1435.279,"we're just about 20 seconds from the"
Yov854ZT1lg,1437.36,"start of our stage one entry burn and"
Yov854ZT1lg,1440.0,"this is a 20 second burn and it'll help"
Yov854ZT1lg,1442.24,"slow the vehicle down as it enters the"
Yov854ZT1lg,1444.72,"thicker parts of the earth's atmosphere"
Yov854ZT1lg,1447.919,"and this is a three engine burn and it"
Yov854ZT1lg,1450.0,"is three engines in a row"
Yov854ZT1lg,1460.96,"stage one entry burn startup"
Yov854ZT1lg,1463.039,"there's the start of the entry burn on"
Yov854ZT1lg,1465.279,"the first stage"
Yov854ZT1lg,1468.72,"you can see those bird fins at the first"
Yov854ZT1lg,1471.039,"stage is flying through its own plume"
Yov854ZT1lg,1473.12,"there stage two fts is safe"
Yov854ZT1lg,1480.64,"stage one don't you burn shut down"
Yov854ZT1lg,1483.919,"we did just have a successful stage one"
Yov854ZT1lg,1486.24,"entry burn there and for those who"
Yov854ZT1lg,1488.32,"follow along you'll know that these foot"
Yov854ZT1lg,1490.48,"on the rocket"
Yov854ZT1lg,1492.96,"second stage trajectory is still nominal"
Yov854ZT1lg,1495.84,"um as i was saying the soot on the"
Yov854ZT1lg,1498.159,"rocket indicates that it's been flown"
Yov854ZT1lg,1500.159,"before so the fuel that we use on falcon"
Yov854ZT1lg,1503.039,"9 is rocket grade kerosene or rp1 which"
Yov854ZT1lg,1505.919,"is carbon based so when it burns it"
Yov854ZT1lg,1508.08,"generates soot"
Yov854ZT1lg,1509.44,"now as the booster approaches the"
Yov854ZT1lg,1510.96,"landing site and does that long re-entry"
Yov854ZT1lg,1513.039,"burn that we just saw"
Yov854ZT1lg,1514.4,"we saw it fly through its own plume"
Yov854ZT1lg,1516.24,"which deposits that soot back onto the"
Yov854ZT1lg,1519.039,"first stage"
Yov854ZT1lg,1521.039,"now you can see that sometimes on the"
Yov854ZT1lg,1522.64,"pad the soot is still stuck onto the"
Yov854ZT1lg,1525.44,"first stage from its previous flights"
Yov854ZT1lg,1527.919,"and if you watch closely to your onboard"
Yov854ZT1lg,1529.76,"camera during landing you might be able"
Yov854ZT1lg,1531.44,"to see sticking on the lens of those"
Yov854ZT1lg,1534.0,"cameras as well"
Yov854ZT1lg,1538.32,"now coming up in just a few seconds we"
Yov854ZT1lg,1540.24,"will have the start of our stage one"
Yov854ZT1lg,1542.24,"landing burn"
Yov854ZT1lg,1543.6,"this will be another about 20 second"
Yov854ZT1lg,1545.679,"burn hopefully will land us on our drone"
Yov854ZT1lg,1548.48,"ship a shortfall of gravity time stage"
Yov854ZT1lg,1550.559,"two terminal guidance"
Yov854ZT1lg,1552.08,"in the atlantic ocean"
Yov854ZT1lg,1553.919,"stage one startup"
Yov854ZT1lg,1560.88,"here's the start of our stage one"
Yov854ZT1lg,1562.559,"landing burn"
Yov854ZT1lg,1568.72,"cool views of the drone ship approaching"
Yov854ZT1lg,1571.039,"stage one landing leg deploy"
Yov854ZT1lg,1579.76,"stage"
Yov854ZT1lg,1596.0,"he did just have the 103rd overall"
Yov854ZT1lg,1599.84,"successful recovery of our first stage"
Yov854ZT1lg,1602.48,"overall classroom insertion"
Yov854ZT1lg,1606.0,"and we just missed it there but we did"
Yov854ZT1lg,1607.679,"have a successful second engine cut off"
Yov854ZT1lg,1609.76,"and we just got that confirmation of a"
Yov854ZT1lg,1611.76,"good orbit from stage two"
Yov854ZT1lg,1614.64,"now next up we'll have one more burn on"
Yov854ZT1lg,1616.88,"the second stage that will position the"
Yov854ZT1lg,1618.64,"vehicle for payload deployment expected"
Yov854ZT1lg,1620.88,"loss of signal capable"
Yov854ZT1lg,1623.279,"but we are awaiting the deployment of"
Yov854ZT1lg,1625.279,"our forty nine star looks like awesome"
Yov854ZT1lg,1626.96,"signal bermuda"
Yov854ZT1lg,1628.64,"which is scheduled to occur about six"
Yov854ZT1lg,1630.559,"minutes from now at t plus 15 minutes"
Yov854ZT1lg,1633.279,"however you may have just heard the call"
Yov854ZT1lg,1635.039,"out for expected loss of signal"
Yov854ZT1lg,1637.84,"again this means we won't have live"
Yov854ZT1lg,1640.24,"audio or visual confirmation of payload"
Yov854ZT1lg,1642.799,"deployment due to lack of ground station"
Yov854ZT1lg,1645.2,"coverage but we will acquire signal with"
Yov854ZT1lg,1647.919,"our ground station in kodiak alaska at t"
Yov854ZT1lg,1650.48,"plus 1 hour and 20 minutes so for those"
Yov854ZT1lg,1653.52,"of you who are interested we will keep"
Yov854ZT1lg,1655.12,"the audio only countdown nets up on our"
Yov854ZT1lg,1657.2,"youtube channel and we'll confirm"
Yov854ZT1lg,1659.039,"successful payload deployment on our"
Yov854ZT1lg,1660.88,"social media channels but with that that"

Z3savbVm28M,9.21,"simple submissions that kids can do from"
Z3savbVm28M,11.519,"the mount position lets you start okay"
Z3savbVm28M,14.009,"so Samantha finds herself in the mount"
Z3savbVm28M,16.199,"position she is going to start by"
Z3savbVm28M,17.699,"attacking the Americana submission on"
Z3savbVm28M,19.65,"this arm so Samantha puts her heads"
Z3savbVm28M,21.57,"together go ahead and put your hands"
Z3savbVm28M,22.83,"together we forced the arm all the way"

Z3savbVm28M,25.47,"waiting hello like this over the head"
Z3savbVm28M,27.15,"so now Sam takes her bottom hand she"
Z3savbVm28M,29.58,"goes under the elbow and she grabs her"
Z3savbVm28M,31.26,"own wrist okay"
Z3savbVm28M,32.61,"it's very important when she goes to"
Z3savbVm28M,34.23,"finish this submission she drops the"
Z3savbVm28M,36.27,"elbow close to the ear which she already"

Z3savbVm28M,39.989,"but she's already done okay"
Z3savbVm28M,41.7,"now she's gonna start dragging the wrist"
Z3savbVm28M,43.2,"down below the ear line slowly as she"

ZyjmpkCB9ZI,243.22,"out when you try to roll them over so"
ZyjmpkCB9ZI,245.14,"you got to get that wrap block down and"
ZyjmpkCB9ZI,247.45,"we're gonna practice this with someone"
ZyjmpkCB9ZI,250.59,"but without resisting you this time"
ZyjmpkCB9ZI,253.15,"you're going to get the repetitions in"
ZyjmpkCB9ZI,254.859,"without the resisting and then in a few"
ZyjmpkCB9ZI,256.78,"more minutes we'll do address yes where"
